"<s>[INST] Summarize:Civil Appeal No. 1981 N of 1970.
From the judgment and order dated the 21st May 1970 of the Punjab and Haryana High Court in Letters Patent Appeal No. 195 of 1966.
G.L. Sanghi, S.K. Metha, P.N. Puri and M.K. Dua for the Appellants.
O.P. Sharma and M.S. Dhillon for the Respondents.
The Judgment of the Court was delivered by KOSHAL, J.
This appeal by certificate is directed against the judgment dated May 21, 1970 of a Division Bench of the High Court of Punjab and Haryana accepting a Letters Patent Appeal and holding that in view of the provisions of sections 5, 5 A and 5 B of the Punjab Security of Land Tenures Act, 1953 (hereinafter referred to as the Act), the concerned Collector had no jurisdiction to vary the reserved area of a land owner by including therein the lands sold by him to others.
593 2.
Most of the relevant facts are undisputed and may be briefly stated thus.
Sadh Singh, respondent No. 3, who is a displaced person from Pakistan, was allotted more than 60 standard acres of land in village Karyam, Tehsil Nawanshehar, District Jullundur, in lieu of the land left by him in Pakistan.
He also owned a little more than 1 standard acre of land in village Surwind, Tehsil Patti, District Amritsar.
About 3 years after the Act came into force, i e., on March 9, 1956, respondent No. 3 made an oral gift of some of his land in lieu of maintenance to his wife Nirmal Kaur, respondent No. 4, who entered into an agreement dated January 21,1957 with the three appellants for sale to them of the land gifted to her.
against a consideration of Rs. 4200.
The land covered by the gift was mutated in favour of respondent No. 4 on April 17,1957 and she conveyed the same to the three appellants by a registered sale deed dated August 8, 1957.
The agreement mentioned above as well as the sale deed following it were attested by respondent No. 3 as a marginal witness.
The proceedings for declaration of the surplus area out of the land owned by respondent No. 3 were initiated by the Collector on June 20, 1958.
They passed through various stages before the Collector and in appeal before the Commissioner.
Ultimately the Special Collector, Punjab, declared the surplus area of respondent No. 3 after hearing him and the appellants, through an order dated March 30, 1962, and while doing so, he included the land sold to the appellants by respondent No. 4 in the ""select area"" of respondent No. 3, as prayed for by the appellants.
The order was based on some rulings of the Financial Commissioner, Punjab, to the effect that all sales for valuable consideration effected by a land owner after the enforcement of the Act should be included in his ""select area"".
Respondent No. 3 unsuccessfully challenged the order in an appeal which was dismissed by the Commissioner as time barred.
The order of the Commissioner was upheld in revision by the Financial Commissioner.
It was then that respondent No. 3 knocked at the door of the High Court through a petition under article 226 of the Constitution of India which was dismissed by a learned Single Judge on the ground that the order of the Special Collector had become final by reason of the appeal taken against it being time barred.
The learned Judge observed that respondent No. 3 was not entitled to any relief in exercise of the extra ordinary jurisdiction of the High Court under the said article in view of the fact that he had failed to pursue diligently the remedy of appeal which was open to him.
594 In the appeal which respondent No. 3 filed under clause 10 of the Letters Patent, the Division Bench observed: ""In accordance with section 5 of the Punjab Security of Land Tenures Act, 1953, the appellant intimated his reserved area in form E to the Collector before making the gift in favour of his wife.
This fact is not so stated in the pleadings, but the counsel of both the parties admit this fact to be so"".
and after referring to the provisions of sections 5, 5 A and 5 B of the Act concluded: ""The Collector has no jurisdiction to vary the reserved area of a landowner by including the land sold by him to others in his reserved area.
Under section 5 of the Act, the only jurisdiction with the Collector is to find out whether the reservation has been made in accordance with the directions contained in that section but the Collector has no jurisdiction to include an area in the reserved area of a landowner which is not covered by any of the clauses (a) to (f) of the proviso to section 5 of the Act."" In coming to this conclusion.
the Division Bench relied upon three decisions of the High Court of Punjab and Haryana rendered by other Division Benches and reported as Bhagat Gobind Singh vs Punjab State and others, State of Punjab and others vs Shamsher Singh and others, and Mota Singh vs Financial Commissioner Punjab and if others.
An argument raised before it on behalf of the present appellants that the order of the Collector made in contravention of section 5 of the Act could at best be treated as an illegal order and not one passed without jurisdiction and therefore a nullity, was repelled.
In this connection, reliance was placed by the Division Bench on three judgments of this Court, namely, Nemi Chand Jain vs Financial Commissioner Punjab, Smt.
Kaushalya Devi vs K.L. Bansal, and Bahadur Singh vs Muni Subrat Dass, another.
In the result, the Division Bench held 595 that the order of the Special Collector dated March 30, 1962, directing a variation in the reservation made by respondent No. 3 without his consent was not only contrary to the provisions of the Act but was without jurisdiction and a nullity in as much as the Act vested no power of such variation in the Collector.
It further held that a petition under article 226 of the Constitution of India by respondent No. 3 with the prayer that the order of the Special Collector dated March 30, 1962, be quashed was competent, even though he had not exhausted his remedies of appeal and revision.
In the above premises, the Division Bench accepted the Letters Patent Appeal and set aside the order of the Special Collector dated March 30, 1962, as also those orders which followed and confirmed it, and directed the Collector to declare the surplus area of respondent No. 3 after excluding therefrom the area reserved by him as his Permissible area.
Mr. Sanghi, learned counsel for the appellants, has raised the following contentions before us: (a) The admission to the effect that respondent No. 3 had intimated his reserved area in Form E to the Collector before gifting the land to his wife was made before the High Court on behalf of the appellants on the basis of some misconception on the part of their counsel.
Actually no such reservation was ever made and the admission could at best be interpreted to mean that respondent No. 3 had sent an intimation in Form E to the Special Collector detailing therein the area selected by him as his permissible area in pursuance of the provisions of sub section (1) of section 5 B of the Act.
(b) If no reservation was made by respondent No. 3 the whole basis of the impugned judgment falls and the Collector would have jurisdiction to amend the permissible area of respondent No. 3 by way of adjustment of the equities arising in favour of the appellants.
After hearing Mr. Sanghi we find force in contention (a) but none in contention (b), as we shall presently show.
We may 596 mention here that respondent No. 3 has remained up represented before us in spite of service.
For a proper consideration of the two contentions, it is necessary to refer to certain provisions of the Act as they originally stood, the amendments made thereto in the year 1957 and the rules framed thereunder from time to time.
The Act was enforced on the 15th April 1953.
On that date section 5 thereof comprised 5 sub sections of which sub sections (4) and (5) were omitted in the year 1953 itself.
Sub sections (1) and (3) of that section are relevant and are reproduced below: ""5.
(1) Any reservation before the commencement of this Act shall cease to have effect, and subject to the provisions of sections 3 and 4 any landowner who owns land in excess of the permissible area may reserve out of the entire land held by him in the State of Punjab as landowner, any parcel or parcels not exceeding the permissible area by intimating his selection in the prescribed form and manner to the patwari of the estate in which the land reserved is situate or to such other authority as may be prescribed: ""Provided that in making this reservation he shall include his areas owned in the following order: (a) area held in a Co operative Garden Colony, (b) area under self cultivation at the commencement of this Act other than the reserved area, (c) reserved area excluding the area under a jhundimar tenant or a tenant who has been in continuous occupation for 20 years or more immediately before such reservation, (d) area or share in a Co operative Farming Society, (e) any other area owned by him, (f) area under a jhundimar tenant"".
""(3) A landowner shall be entitled to intimate a reservation within six months from the date of commence 597 ment of this Act, and no reservation so intimated shall be varied subsequently whether by act of parties or by operation of law, save with the consent in writing of the tenant affected by such variation or until such time as the right to eject such tenant otherwise accrues under the provisions of this Act.
"" The term 'reserved area ' was defined in clause (4) of section 2 thus: '(4) ""Reserved area"" means the area lawfully reserved under the Punjab Tenants (Security of Tenure) Act, 1950 (Act XXII of 1950), as amended by President 's Act, V of 1951, hereinafter referred to as the ""1950 Act"" or under this Act. ' The Act as originally framed did not contain any provision for the determination of what is now known as ""surplus area"" a term which was introduced into the Act for the first time in 1955 through the addition of clause (5 a) to section 2.
On the 19th May 1953 were promulgated the Punjab Security of Land Tenures Rules, 1953 (for short, the 1953 Rules), under rule 3 of which a landowner had to notify his reservation to the Patwari of the concerned estate in pursuance of the provisions of sub section (1) of section 5 of the Act in the Form designated as Annexure ""B"" to those Rules.
On the 27th April 1956 were promulgated the Punjab Security of Land Tenures Rules, 1956 (hereinafter referred to as the 1956 Rules).
It was by rule 4 thereof that Form E was for the first time prescribed.
That rule stated: ""4.
Where a landowner has not reserved the area permitted for self cultivation, he will, at the same time as he submits the declarations prescribed in rule 3 above, intimate, in writing, to the Patwari/Patwaris of the Circle/ Circles in which his lands are situated, the land/lands selected by him for self cultivation.
This intimation shall be in Form E."" This rule clearly indicates that a landowner was given the right to select an area for self cultivation only in case he had not reserved such area on or before the 15th October, 1953.
598 Sections 5 A and 5 B were added to the Act in the year 1957 with effect from 11th December 1957 by means of Punjab Act No. 46 of 1957.
They state: Section 5 A ""Every land owner or tenant.
who owns or holds land in excess of the permissible area and where land is situated in more than one Patwar Circle, shall furnish, within a period of six months from the commencement of the Punjab Security of Land Tenures (Amendment) Act, 1957, a declaration supported by an affidavit in respect of the land owned or held by him in such form and manner and to such authority as may be prescribed."" Section 5 B ""(1) A land owner who has not exercised his right of reservation under this Act, may select his permissible area and intimate the selection to the prescribed authority within the period specified in section 5 A and in such form and manner as may be prescribed: ""Provided that a land owner who is required to furnish a declaration under section 5 A shall intimate his selection along with that declaration. ""(2) If a land owner fails to select his permissible area in accordance with the provisions of sub section (1), the prescribed authority may, subject to the provisions of section 5 C, select the parcel or parcels of lands which such person is entitled to retain under the provisions of this Act: ""Provided that the prescribed authority shall not make the selection without giving the land owner concerned an opportunity of being heard"".
Simultaneously the definition of 'surplus area ' contained in clause (5 a) of section 2 of the Act was amended to read thus: 599 '(5 a) ""Surplus Area"" means the area other than the reserved area, and, where no area has been reserved, the area in excess of the permissible area selected under section 5 B or the area which is deemed to be surplus area under sub section (1) of section 5 C and includes the area in excess of the permissible area selected under section 19 B, but it will not include a tenant 's permissible area: 'Provided that it will include the reserved area, or part thereof, where such area or part has not been brought under self cultivation within six months of reserving the same or getting possession thereof after ejecting a tenant from it, whichever is later, or if the landowner admits a new tenant, within three years of the expiry of the said six months. ' In consequence of these additions rule 4 of the 1956 Rules was also amended so as to contain a provision that an intimation under section 5 B (1) of the Act shall be furnished by a landowner in Form E. 6.
In relation to contention (a) the following propositions emerge from the various provisions of law just above set out: (i) Reservation of land was envisaged only in section 5 (1) of the Act and had to be intimated within six months from the date of commencement of that Act, i.e., on or before the 15th October 1953.
(ii) No provision was ever made in the Act or the rules framed thereunder fora reservation of land by a landowner who had failed to send an intimation thereof on or before the 15th October 1953.
(iii)What was provided by section 5 B was, inter alia, that a landowner who had not exercised the right of reservation under the Act could select his permissible area and send intimation thereof in Form E to the prescribed authority within a period of six months from the 11th December, 1957, i.e. on or before 11th May, 1958.
Reservation ' was something different from the 'Selection ' 600 of permissible area.
The two terms were not only not synonymous but were mutually exclusive. 'Selection ' of permissible area was allowed only to a landlord who had not exercised his right of 'reservation ' (iv) Form was meant only for intimation of selection of permissible area under sub section (1) of section 5 B and not for reservation under sub section (1) of section 5 which could be made only through an intimation in the Form in Annexure ""B"" to the 1953 Rules.
The propositions just above enunciated bring out incongruity from which the admission made before the High Court suffers.
There could be no reservation in Form E by respondent No. 3.
If he send an intimation in that Form it could only be about a selection of his permissible area under sub section (1) of section 5 B. That this was really so clearly appears from the following observation made in the order of the Special Collector dated 2nd March 1961: ""The counsel for the owner argued that area sold was not included in Form E filed before the Special Collector and that he was not prepared to include it in the select area of 50 S.A. to which he is entitled"".
The order from which this observation has been extracted was set aside by the Commissioner, Jullundur Division, on the 8th January, 1962 when the case was remanded to the Special Collector for a fresh decision after hearing the three appellants as well as respondents Nos. 3 & 4.
The Special Collector then heard all these parties and passed his order dated the 30th March 1962 which also unmistakably indicates that the intimation given by respondent No. 3 to the Special Collector was not in respect of any reservation but covered only a selection of the permissible area.
Reference in this connection may be made to the fact that twice in that order the Special Collector used the term ""select area"" in relation to the lands which respondent No. 3 could be allowed to retain in his possession .
In assuming (on the basis of the admission made at the bar) that respondent No. 3 had intimated his reservation in pursuance of sub section (1) of section 5, the High Court was thus in error and 601 the case has to be decided on the basis of the factual position that respondent No. 3 had failed to make any reservation under that subsection but that he has made a selection in Form E in pursuance of the provisions of sub section (1) of section 5 B. Contention (a) raised by Mr. Sanghi is, therefore, accepted in full.
We now proceed to consider contention (b) in the light of the provisions above extracted, a bare reading of which leads to the following conclusions in relation to that contention: (a) 'Surplus area ' is arrived at by excluding the reserved area from the total area of a land owner in case a reservation has been made by him lawfully.
(Clauses (4) and (5 a) of section 2.) (b) Where no area has been lawfully reserved by the land owner, surplus area is worked out under section 5 B or 5 C] (c) Under section 5, the landowner is entitled to reserve out of the entire land held by him in the State of Punjab as landowner, any parcel or parcels not exceeding the permissible area by intimating his selection in the prescribed form and manner to the patwari of the estate, etc.
In doing so he is legally bound to include in his reserved area such land as conform to the description of any of the 6 categories covered by clauses (a) to (f) of the proviso to sub section (1) of section 5.
(d) Once a reservation has been intimated within 6 months from the date of commencement of the Act, it cannot be varied either by act of parties or by operation of law, except with the written consent of the tenant affected by such variation.
(e) If a land owner has failed to reserve land in accordance with the provisions of section 5, he has another chance to select his permissible area within six months from the commencement of the Punjab Security of Land Tenures (Amendment) Act (Punjab Act No. 46 of 1957) in the prescribed manner.
602 (f) The prescribed authority is given the power to select the permissible area of a landowner under sub section (2) of section 5 B but the mandatory condition attached to the exercise of that power is that it shall be resorted to only if the landowner has failed to select his permissible area in accordance with the provisions of sub section (1) of that section.
In other words, if the concerned land owner has already selected his permissible area in accordance with the provisions of sub section (1) of section 5 B, sub section (2) of that section does not come into play at all and there is no occasion for the exercise by the prescribed authority of the power of selection.
These conclusions further lead to the inference that if the prescribed authority (in this case the Special Collector) exercises the power of selection in a situation to which sub section 5 B is not attracted, his order would be without jurisdiction and a nullity and that is precisely what has happened in this case.
As held by us earlier, respondent No. 3 had made a selection of his permissible area in accordance with the provisions of sub section (1) of section 5 B a selection which the prescribed authority had no power to vary either under sub section (2) of section 5 B or under any other provisions of the Act.
The order of the Special Collector dated March 30, 1962 must, therefore, be held to have been passed without jurisdiction and, therefore, to be a nullity.
In support of the proposition that the order of the Special Collector did not suffer from lack of jurisdiction, learned counsel for the appellants has relied upon the following observations in Gurcharan Singh and Others vs Prithi Singh and Others, wherein this Court defined the scope of powers of the Collector while acting under sub section (2) of section 5 B of the Act: ""While it is true that a landowner who fails to reserve or select his permissible area within the prescribed period, cannot exercise that right subsequently, and thereafter it is for the Collector to determine the defaulter 's permissible and surplus areas, in exercising this power under section 5 B, the Collector has to act judicially.
He is bound to give notice to the landowner, and the transferees from him, 603 if known.
Thereafter he has to hear the parties who appear, and to take into consideration their representations and then pass such order as may be just.
In so exercising his discretion, the Collector may, subject to the adjustment of equities on both sides, include the transferred area in the 'permissible area ' or the 'surplus area ' of the landowner.
Thus, in the process the Collector is not to ignore altogether the wishes of the landowner.
He may accept them to the extent they are consistent with the equities of the case"".
It is urged on the authority of these observations that the Collector has in all cases the power to alter the particulars of an area reserved or selected by a landowner so as to bring it in conformity with any equities that may arise in the attendant circumstances.
This proposition is wholly unacceptable to us for the simple reason that in Gurcharan Singh 's case (supra), the landowner had made neither a reservation nor a selection of his permissible area within the prescribed period, so that sub section (2) of section 5 B was undoubtedly attracted to his case.
The observations above extracted were obviously confined to a case of that type, and have nothing to do with a situation where the landowner concerned has selected his permissible area in accordance with the provisions of sub section (1) of section 5 B so that there is no occasion for the prescribed authority to exercise his powers under sub section (2) of that section.
Gurcharn Singh 's case, therefore, is of no assistance at all to the case of the appellants.
Nor do we see how any equities arise in favour of the appellants, such as would entitle them to have the land in question included in the permissible area of respondent No. 3.
It is not their case that any representation to the effect that land would be so included was made to them by either respondent No. 3 or respondent No. 4.
Furthermore they must be credited with full knowledge of the extent of the land owned by respondent No. 3 and of the consequences flowing therefrom in view of the provisions of the Act.
Thus they acquired the land with their eyes open and subject to all the liabilities and defects from which it suffered in the hands of their transferor (and also their transferor 's transferor).
In the absence of word of month of respondent No. 3 or his conduct to the contrary; they cannot now be heard to say that if respondent No. 3 exercises a right of selection of his permissible area which the Act confers on him, that right must be modified to suit their convenience.
604 In this connection we may also mention that the inclusion of the land in question in the surplus area of respondent No. 3 does not affect the right of ownership of the appellants.
Of course the result of such inclusion would certainly be that the concerned authorities would be enabled to settle tenants on the land as permitted by the Act and that is a risk which the appellants must be deemed to have bought with the land.
For the reasons stated we dismiss the appeal but with no order as to costs.
N.V.K. Appeal dismissed.
","Respondent No. 3, a displaced person from Pakistan, was allotted more than 60 standard acres of land.
Out of this land he made an oral gift of some land in lieu of maintenance to his wife, respondent No. 4, who sold that land to the appellants.
In the proceedings for declaration of the surplus area of the land owned by respondent No. 3 the Special Collector included the land sold to the appellants in the ""select area"" of Respondent No. 3.
The appeal of Respondent No. 3 to the Commissioner was dismissed as time barred and this order was upheld in revision by the Financial Commissioner.
A single Judge dismissed his petition under Article 226.
In appeal, a Division Bench held that the order of the Special Collector, directing a variation in the reservation made by respondent No. 3 without his consent was not only contrary to the provisions of the Act but was without jurisdiction and a nullity in as much as the Act vested no power of such variation in the Collector.
In the appeal to this Court it was contended on behalf of the appellant, that: (1) the admission to the effect that respondent No. 3 had intimated his reserved area in Form E to the Collector before gifting the land to his wife was made before the High Court on behalf of the appellants on the basis of some misconception on the part of their counsel, that actually no such reservation was ever made and that the admission could at best be interpreted to mean that respondent No. 3 had sent an intimation in Form E to the Special Collector detailing therein the area selected by him as his permissible area in pursuance of the provisions of sub section (1) of section 5 B of the Act, and (2) If no reservation was made by respondent No. 3 the whole basis of the impugned judgment falls and the Collector would have jurisdiction to amend the permissible area of respondent No. 3 by way of adjustment of the equities arising in favour of the appellants.
Dismissing the appeal, ^ HELD: In assuming that respondent No. 3 had intimated his reservation in pursuance of sub section (1) of section 5, the High Court was in error 591 and the case had to be decided on the basis of the factual position that respondent No. 3 had failed to make any reservation under that sub section but that he had made a selection in Form E in pursuance of the provisions of sub section (1) of section 5 B. [600 H 601A] The inclusion of the land in question in the surplus area of respondent No. 3 does not effect the right of ownership of the appellants.
[604 A] 1.
(a) Reservation of land was envisaged only in section 5(1) of the Act and had to be intimated within six months from the date of its commencement i.e. on or before the 15th October, 1953.
[599 E] (b) No provision was ever made in the Act or the rules framed thereunder for a reservation of land by a land owner who had failed to send an intimation thereof on or before the 15th October, 1953.
[599 F] (c) What was provided by section 5 B was, that a landowner who had not exercised the right of reservation under the Act could select his permissible area and send intimation thereof in Form E to the prescribed authority within a period of six months from the 11th December, 1957 i. e. on or before 11th May, 1958. 'Reservation ' was something different from the 'Selection ' of permissible area.
The two terms were not only not synonymous but were mutually exclusive. 'Selection ' of permissible area was allowed only to a landlord who had not exercised his right of 'reservation '.
[599 G 600 A] (d) Form E was meant only for intimation of selection of permissible area under sub section (1) of section 5B and not for reservation under sub section (1) of section 5 which could be made only through an intimation in the Form in Annexure ""B"" to the 1953 Rules.
[600 B] 2.(a) 'Surplus area ' is arrived at by excluding the reserved area from the total area of a land owner in case a reservation has been made by him lawfully.
(Clauses (4) and (5 a) of section 2.) [601 C] (b) Where no area has been lawfully reserved by the land owner, surplus area is worked out under section 5B or 5C. [601 D] (c) Under section 5, the landowner is entitled to reserve out of the entire land held by him in the State as landowner, any parcel or parcels not exceeding the permissible area by intimating his selection in the prescribed form to the Patwari of the estates, etc.
In doing so he is legally bound to include in his reserved area such land as conforms to the description of any of the 6 categories covered by clauses (a) to (f) of the proviso to sub section (1) of section 5.
[601E] (d) Once a reservation has been intimated within 6 months from the date of commencement of the Act, it cannot be varied either by act of parties or by operation of law, except with the written consent of tenant affected by such variation.
(e) If a land owner has failed to reserve land in accordance with the provisions of section 5 he has another chance to select his permissible area within 6 months from the commencement of the Punjab Security of Land Tenures (Amendment) Act, 1937.
[601 G] (f) The prescribed authority is given the power to select the permissible area of a landowner under sub section (2) of section 5 B but the mandatory condition attached to the exercise of that power is that it shall be resorted to only if the landowner has failed to select his permissible area in accordance with the provisions of sub section (1) of that section.
In other words, if the concerned land owner has already selected his permissible area in accordance with the provision of sub section (1) of section 5 B, sub section (2) of that section does not come into play at all and there is no occasion for the exercise by the prescribed authority or the power of selection.
[602 A C ] In the instant case Respondent No. 3 had made a selection of his permissible area in accordance with the provisions of sub section (1) of section 5 B, a selection which the prescribed authority had no power to vary either under sub section (2) of section 5 B or under any other provisions of the Act.
The order of the Special Collector dated March 30, 1962 was therefore passed without jurisdiction and was a nullity.

</s>"," lector has no jurisdiction to vary the reserved area of a landowner by including therein the lands sold by him to others.
Section 5 A does not confer any such power on the Collector.
Section 5 B only provides that if the landowner makes a gift of any part of his reserved area, the Collector shall include the gifted portion in the reserved area of the landowner.
There is no provision in the Act to include the lands sold by the landowner in his reserved area.
The learned Single Judge was right in holding that the order of the Special Collector was bad in law.
We do not find any error in the reasoning of the learned Single Judge.
The appeal is accordingly allowed and the order of the Special Collector is set aside.
The appellants will pay costs.

"<s>[INST] Summarize:ION: Special Leave Petition (Civil) No. 7534 of 1987.
From the Judgment and Order dated 4.11.
1986 of the Kerala High Court in M.F.A. No. 64 of 1982.
E.M.S. Anam for the Petitioner.
The Order of the Court was delivered by VENKATARAMIAH, J.
The petitioner was the owner of a bus bearing No. KLD 9327 which was being run as a stage car riage.
On 24.7.1978 while the said bus was carrying passen gers it met with an accident and Saheeda, who was one of the passengers in the bus, died as a consequence of the said accident.
The accident took place, according to the Motor Accidents Claims Tribunal, due to the negligence on the part of the driver of the vehicle who had been employed by the petitioner.
The Tribunal found that the compensation payable by the petitioner to the legal representatives of Saheeda was Rs.56,800.
It, however, held that the liability of the insurer to indemnify the petitioner was limited to Rs.5,000 as the policy specifically limited the insurer 's 1153 liability to what had been provided by section 95(2)(b)(ii)(2) and (4) of (herein after referred to as the Act ').
Aggrieved by the decision of the Tribunal the petitioner filed an appeal before the High Court of Kerala.
The said appeal was dismissed.
This peti tion is filed under Article 136 of the Constitution for special leave to appeal against the judgment of the High Court.
The contention of the petitioner before this Court is that the insurer was liable to indemnify the petitioner upto a limit of Rs.75,000 under section 95(2)(b)(ii)(2) of the Act and that the further limit mentioned in section 95(2)(b)(ii)(4) of the Act was inapplicable to the case of the petitioner.
The relevant part of section 95 of the Act during the relevant time read as follows: ""95(2).
Subject to the proviso to sub section (1), a policy of insurance shall cover any liability incurred in respect of any one accident up to the following limits, namely (a) where the vehicle is a goods vehicle, a limit of fifty thousand rupees in all, including the liabilities, if any, aris ing under the (8 of 1923), in respect of the death of, or bodily injury to, employees (other than the driver), not exceeding six in number, being carried in the vehicle; (b) where the vehicle is a vehicle in which passengers are carried for hire or reward or by reason of or in pursuance of a contract of employment , (i) in respect of persons other than passengers carried for hire or reward, a limit of fifty thousand rupees in all; (ii) in respect of passengers, (1) a limit of fifty thousand rupees in all where the vehicle is registered to carry not more than thirty passengers; (2) a limit of seventy five thou sand rupees in all where the vehicle is regis tered to carry more than thirty but not more than sixty passengers; 1154 (3) a limit of one lakh rupees in all where the vehicle is registered to carry more than sixty passengers; and (4) subject to the limits aforesaid, ten thousand rupees for each individual pas senger where the vehicle is a motor cab, and five thousand rupees for each individual passenger in any other case; (c) save as provided in clause (d), where the vehicle is a vehicle of any other class, the amount of liability incurred; (d) irrespective of the class of the vehicle, a limit of rupees two thousand in all in respect of damage to any property of a third party.
Section 95 of the Act sets out the requirements of the policies of insurance which must be taken by the owners of motor vehicles and the limits of liabilities thereunder.
A policy of insurance should subject to the proviso to sub section (1) of section 95 of the Act cover any liability incurred in respect of any one accident upto the limits specified in sub section (2) of section 95 of the Act.
Clause (a) of section 95(2) of the Act during the relevant time provided that where the vehicle was a goods vehicle the policy should cover the liability upto Rs.50,000 in all including the liabilities, if any, arising under the Work men 's Compensation Act, 1923 in respect of death of or bodily injury to the workmen (other than the driver) not exceeding six in number being carried in the vehicle.
This clause came up for consideration before this Court in Motor Owners Insurance Co. Ltd. vs Jadavji Keshavji Modi & Ors., In that case this Court held that clause (a) of section 95(2) of the Act qualified the extent of the insurer 's liability by the use of the unambiguous expression ""in all"" and since that expression was specially introduced by an amendment, it must be allowed its full play.
The legislature must be presumed to have intended what it had plainly said.
But clause (a) did not stand alone and was not the only provision to be considered for determining the outside limit of the insurer 's liability.
It was necessary to give effect to the words 'any one accident ' which formed part in the opening part of sub section (2) of section 95 of the Act.
The Court, therefore, held that if more than one person was injured during the course of the same transaction each one of the persons must be deemed to have met with an accident.
Accordingly, 1155 the Court held that each of the persons who was entitled to claim compensation under clause (a) of sub section (2) of section 95 of the Act was entitled to claim a sum of Rs.50,000 which was the limit prescribed by the said clause on the date on which the accident, referred to in that case, occurred.
The Court, however, distinguished the decision of this Court in Sheikhupura Transport Co. Ltd. vs Northern India Transport Insurance Co., [1971] Supp.
SCR 20 which was a case in which clause (b) of sub section (2) of section 95 of the Act had arisen for consideration.
In doing so the Court observed thus: ""The judgment of the Punjab High Court was brought in appeal to this Court in Sheikhupura Transport Co. Ltd. vs Northern India Transport Co. For reasons aforesaid, the judgment in that case is not an authority on the interpretation of clause (a) of section 95(2).
After setting out the relevant provi sions of section 95(2) at pages 24 and 25 of the Report, Hegde J. speaking for himself and Jaganmohan Reddy, J. concluded: 'In the present case we are dealing with a vehicle in which more than six passen gers were allowed to be carried.
Hence the maximum liability imposed under section 95(2) on the insurer is Rs.2,000 per passenger though the total liability may go upto Rs.20,000. ' Towards the end of the judgment, it was observed that reading the provision con tained in sections 95 and 96 together ' . it is clear that the statutory liability of the insurer to indemnify the insured is as prescribed in section 95(2).
Hence the High Court was right in its conclusion that the liability of the insurer in the present case only ex tends upto Rs.2,000 each, in the case of Bachan Singh and Narinder Nath. ' In view of the limit on the insurer 's liability in re spect of each passenger, the argument on the construction of the words 'any one accident ' had no relevance and was therefore neither made nor considered by the Court.
Different considerations may arise under clause (b), as amended by Act 56 of 1969, but we do not propose to make any observations on that aspect of the matter, since it does not di rectly arise before us.
"" Section 95(2)(b) as it existed before its amendment in 1982 dealt with the limits of the liability of an insurer in the case of motor vehicles 1156 in which passengers were carried for hire or reward or by reason of or in pursuance of a contract of employment.
Sub clause (i) of section 95(2)(b) provided that in respect of death of or injury to persons other than passengers carried for hire or reward a limit of Rs.50,000 in all was the limit of the liability of the insurer.
Sub clause (ii) dealt with the liability in respect of death of or injury to passen gers.
Under that sub clause there were two specific limits on the liability of the insurer in the case of motor vehi cles carrying passengers.
The first limit related to the aggregate liability of the insurer in any one accident.
It was fixed at Rs.50,000 in all where the vehicle was regis tered to carry not more than thirty passengers, at Rs.75,000 in all where the vehicle was registered to carry more than thirty but not more than sixty passengers and at Rs. 1,00,000 in all where the vehicle was registered to carry more than sixty passengers.
The said sub clause proceeded to lay down the other limit in respect of each passenger by providing that subject to the limits aforesaid as regards the aggregate liability, the liability extended up to Rs. 10,000 for each individual passenger where the vehicle was a motor cab and Rs.5,000 for each individual passenger in any other case.
Neither of the two limits can be ignored.
In the present case the vehicle in question being a bus carrying passengers for hire or reward registered to carry more than thirty but not more than sixty passengers the limit of the aggregate liability of the insurer in any one accident was Rs.75,000 and subject to the said limit the liability in respect of each individual passenger was Rs.5,000.
We find it difficult to hold that the limit prescribed in section 95(2)(b)(ii)(4) was only the minimum liability prescribed by law.
The amount mentioned in that provision provides the maximum amount payable by an insurer in respect of each passenger who has suffered on account of the accident.
This appears to us to be a fair construction of section 95(2) of the Act as it existed at the time when the accident took place.
Our view receives support from at least two decisions of this Court.
In Sheikhupura Transport Co. Ltd. vs Northern India Transport Insurance Co. (supra) the motor vehicle involved was a passenger bus.
On account of an accident which took place on account of the negligence of the driver of the said vehicle two persons died on the spot.
Their legal represen tatives claimed compensation before the Motor Accidents Claims Tribunal.
The Tribunal found that the legal represen tatives of each of the two persons who had died on account of the accident, were entitled to compensation of Rs. 18,000 and directed that the entire sum should be paid by the insurance company.
On appeal by the legal representatives as well as by the insurance company the High Court enhanced the compensation payable to the legal 1157 representatives of each of the two deceased persons to Rs.36,000 and also allowed the appeal of the insurance company and limited its liability to the tune of Rs.2,000 in respect of each of the two deceased persons in accordance with section 95(2)(b) of the Act as it stood at the relevant time which provided that where the vehicle was a vehicle in which passengers were carried for hire or reward or by reason of or in pursuance of a contract of employment in respect of persons other than passengers carried for hire or reward, a limit of Rs.20,000 and in respect of passengers a limit of Rs.20,000 in all and Rs.2,000 in respect of an individual passenger if the vehicle was registered to carry more than six persons excluding the driver.
The Court ob served that since in the said case the vehicle was one in which more than six persons were allowed to be carried the maximum liability imposed under section 95(2) of the Act on the insurer was Rs.2,000 per passenger though the total liability might go upto Rs.20,000 in a given case where large number of persons had suffered on account of the accident.
Accordingly the Court affirmed the judgment of the High Court insofar as the question of the liability of the insurer was concerned.
Clause (b) of section 95(2) of the Act again came up for consideration before this Court in Manjusri Raha & Ors. etc.
vs B.L. Gupta & Ors.
; In that case also the motor vehicle which was involved in the accident was a bus carrying passengers on a route in the State of Madhya Pradesh.
The Court followed the decision in the case of Sheikhupura Transport Co. Ltd. vs Northern India Trans port Insurance Co., (supra) and limited the liability of the insurer to Rs.2,000 as provided by the Act at that time.
The Court found itself in complete agreement with the observa tions made by the Kerala High Court in P.B. Kader & Ors.
vs Thatchamma and Ors., AIR 1970 Kerala 241, and approved the following observations made by the Kerala High Court: ""It is sad that an Indian life should be so devalued by an Indian law as to cost only Rs.2,000, apart from the fact that the value of the Indian rupee has been eroded and Indian life has become dealer since the time the statute was enacted, and the consciousness of the comforts and amenities of life in the Indian community has arisen, it would have been quite appropriate to revise this fossil figure of Rs.2,000 per individual, involved in an accident, to make it more realistic and humane, but that is a matter for the legisla ture; and the observation that I have made is calculated to remind the law makers that humanism is the basis of law and justice."" 1158 The Court also suggested on its own that instead of limiting the liability of the insurance companies to a specified sum of rupees as representing the value of human life, the amount should be left to be determined by a Court in the special circumstances of each case, even in the case where passenger vehicles were responsible for the incident.
Fazal Ali, J. who delivered the judgment in the above case further observed at pages 950 95 1 thus: ""While our Legislature has made laws to cover every possible situation, yet it is well nigh impossible to make provisions for all kinds of situations.
Nevertheless where the social need of the hour requires that precious human lives lost in motor accidents leaving a trail of economic disaster in the shape of their unpro vided for families call for special attention of the law makers to meet this social need by providing for heavy and adequate compensation particularly through insurance companies.
It is true that while our law makers are the best judges of the requirements of the society, yet it is indeed surprising that such an important aspect of the matter has missed their atten tion.
Our country can iII afford the loss of a precious life when we are building a progres sive society and if any person engaged in industry, office, business or any other occu pation dies, a void is created which is bound to result in a serious set back to the indus try or occupation concerned.
Apart from that the death of a worker creates a serious eco nomic problem for the family which he leaves behind.
In these circumstances it is only just and fair that the Legislature should make a suitable provision so as to pay adequate compensation by properly evaluating the pre cious life of a citizen in its true perspec tive rather than devaluing human lives on the basis of an artificial mathematical formula.
It is common knowledge that where a passenger travelling by a plane dies in an accident, he gets a compensation of Rs.1,00,000 or like large sums, and yet when death comes to him not through a plane but through a motor vehi cle he is entitled only to Rs.2,000.
Does it indicate that the life of a passenger travel ling by plane becomes more precious merely because he has chosen a particular conveyance and the value of his life is considerably reduced if he happens to choose a conveyance of a lesser value like a motor vehicle? Such an invidious distinction is absolutely shock ing to any judicial or social conscience and yet section 95(2)(d) of the seems to suggest such a distinction.
We 1159 hope and trust that our law makers will give serious attention to this aspect of the matter and remove this serious lacuna in section 95(2)(d) of the .
"" These observations were quoted with approval by this Court in the course of its judgment in Motor Owners Insur ance Co. Ltd. vs Jadavji Keshavji Modi & Ors., (supra) and while doing so the Court observed that the above observa tions were still languishing in the cold.
storage of pious wishes.
Immediately after the decision in the Motor Owners Insurance Co. Ltd. vs Jadavji Keshavji Modi & Ors.
(supra) Parliament took steps to amend sub clause (ii) of clause (b) of section 95(2) of the Act by Act 47 of 1982.
After the said amendment subclause (ii) of clause (b) of section 95(2) of the Act reads thus: ""95(2)(b).
Where the vehicle is a vehicle in which passengers are carried for hire or reward of by reason of or in pursuance of a contract of employment . . . . . . . . . . . (ii) in respect of passengers, a limit of fifteen thousand rupees for each individual passenger.
. . . . . . . . . . "" As the law stands today the insurer is liable to pay upto Rs.15,000 in respect of death of any passenger or any injury caused to him.
In the Statement of Objects and Rea sons attached to the Bill which ultimately became Act 47 of 1982 it was stated that the limit with respect to an insur er 's liability to a passenger involved in an accident in a public service vehicle was being fixed at Rs.15,000.
After the above amendment, which was intended to increase the liability of the insurer, instead of Rs.10,000 in the case of each individual passenger where the vehicle was a motor cab and Rs.5,000 for each individual passenger in other cases which were the limits in force immediately prior to the said amendment the liability in respect of an individual passenger is now raised to Rs.15,000.
This clearly demon strates that Parliament never intended that the aggregate liability of the insurer mentioned in subclauses (1), (2) and (3) of section 95(2)(b)(ii) of the Act would be the liability of the insurer even when one passenger had died or suffered injury on account of an accident.
Such liability was always further limited by sub clause (4) of section 95(2)(b)(ii) of the Act.
Even in the latest Bill, i.e., Bill No. 56 of 1987 which was introduced in the Lok Sabha on the 11th of May, 1987 for the purpose of consolidating and amending the law in regard to the motor vehicles it is proposed by 1160 section 147 to retain the provision regarding the limit of the insurer 's liability in respect of vehicles in which passengers are carried for hire or reward or by reason of or in pursuance of a contract of employment as it was provided by Act 47 of 1982.
Section 147(2)(b)(ii) of the Bill reads thus: ""147(2).
Subject to the proviso to sub section (1), a policy of insurance shall cover any liability incurred in respect of any one accident up to the following limits, namely: . . . . . . . . . . . (b) where the vehicle is a vehicle in which passengers are carried for hire or, reward or by reason of or in pursuance of a contract of employment; . . . . . . . . . . (ii) in respect of passengers, a limit of fifteen thousand, rupees for each individual passenger, . . . . . . . . . .
Having regard to the large number of motor vehicles accidents which are taking place on roads and also to the fact that a large number of public service vehicles carrying passengers are involved in them, we are of the view that the limit of Rs.15,000 fixed in the case of each passenger appears to be still meagre and we hope that Parliament while enacting the Bill into law would take steps to increase the insurer 's liability keeping in view the need for providing for adequate compensation as a measure of social security.
We should at this stage state that the High Court of Madras in K.R. Sivagami, Proprietor, Rajendran Tourist vs Mahaboob Nisa Bi and Others, has taken the same view as regards the effect of section 95(2)(b)(ii) of the Act as it stood before its amendment in 1982.
It has observed that the said provision specifically provided for two limitations on the liability of the insurer in respect of an accident in which a vehicle carrying passengers was involved, the first limitation being the limitation con tained in sub clauses (1), (2) and (3) of section 95(2)(b)(ii) which provided that for the aggregate liability of the insurer in an accident and the second limitation being the one contained in sub clause (4) of section 95(2)(b)(ii) which provided that subject to the limits aforesaid Rs.10,000 for each individual passenger where the vehicle was a motor cab and Rs.5,000 1161 for each individual passenger in any other case.
Khalid, J., as he then was, of the Kerala High Court has also accepted the same construction of section 95(2)(b) in Madras Motor and General Insurance Co. Ltd. by its successor: The United Fire and General Insurance Co. Ltd. and others vs V.P. Balakrishnan and others.
, The High Court of Allahabad in New India Assurance Co. Ltd. vs Mahmood Ahmad and others, the High Court of Bombay in Shivahari Rama Tiloji and another vs Kashi Vishnu Agarwadekar and others, and the High Court of Patna in National Insurance Co. Ltd. vs Shanim Ahmad and others, and in Tara Pada Roy vs Dwijendra Nath Sen and others, have over looked the cumulative effect of sub clauses (1), (2) and (3) and of sub clause (4) of section 95(2)(b)(ii) of the Act.
They have failed to give effect to section 95(2)(b)(ii)(4) of the Act.
We are of the view that these decisions do not lay down the correct view.
We may, however, state here that in Noor Mohammad and another vs Phoola Rani and others, 18 and in Raghib Nasim and another vs Naseem Ahmed and others, two Division Benches of the Allahabad High Court have construed the provision in ques tion as we have done in this case.
The decision of the Single Judge of the Allahabad High Court in New India Assur ance Co. Ltd. vs Mahmood Ahmad and others, (supra) is dis sented from in the later decision of the Division Bench of the Allahabad High Court in Raghib Nasim and another vs Naseem Ahmad and others, (supra).
Having regard to the statute as it stood prior to the amendments by Act 47 of 1982 we hold that the insurer was liable to pay upto Rs.10,000 for each individual passenger where the vehicle involved was a motor cab and upto Rs.5,000 for each individual passenger in any other case.
The judg ment of the Kerala High Court against which this petition is filed has followed the above construction.
We do not find any ground to interfere with it.
This petition is, there fore, dismissed.
In the end we propose to make a few suggestions to the Central Government in respect of certain provisions in Chapters X, XI and XII of the Motor Vehicles Bill No. 56 of 1987 now pending before Parliament which relate to the liability without fault in certain cases, insurance of motor vehicles against third party risks and Claims Tribunals.
Sections 140, 147, 161 and 166 in the Motor Vehicles Bill No. 56 of 1987 correspond to sections 92A, 95, 109A and 110A of the present Act.
The Bill does not propose to introduce any change in sections 1162 140, 147, 161 and 166 of the Bill from what the law is today.
They are almost identical with the existing provi sions.
In section 140 of the Bill which corresponds to section 92A of the Act the liability to pay compensation in the case of death of any person or in the case of permanent disablement of any person is proposed to be retained at Rs. 15,000 and Rs.7,500 respectively in the same way in which the law stands today.
Having regard to the inflationary pressures and the consequent loss of purchasing power of the rupee we feel that the amount of Rs.15,000 and the amount of Rs.7,500 in the above provisions appear to have become unrealistic.
We, therefore, suggest that the limits of compensation in respect of death and in respect of permanent disablement, payable in the event of there being no proof of fault, should be raised adequately to meet the current situation.
Section 147 in the Bill corresponds to section 95 of the present Act, Here again the Government may consider whether it is necessary to continue the distinction between public service vehicles and other motor vehicles in regard to the liability of the insurer to pay compensation.
We also do not find any justification for continuing the distinction between the liability of the insurer to pay compensation to passengers and the liability of the insurer to pay compensa tion to other third parties under the said provisions.
Even among the public service vehicles a distinction is made in the said provisions between vehicles used as goods carriages and vehicles used for the purpose of carrying passengers.
The Central Government may consider whether the limits of liability of the insurer now incorporated in section 147 of the Bill should not be altered suitably.
Section 161 in the Bill corresponds to section 109A of the present Act which makes special provisions as to compensation payable in cases of hit and run motor accidents.
This provision provides for payment of Rs.5,000 in respect of death of any person re sulting from a hit and run motor accident and for the pay ment of Rs.1,000 in respect of grievous injury to a person from a hit and run motor accident.
It is a matter of common knowledge that hit and run motor accidents are increasing in number.
The society and the State which are responsible for such large number of motor vehicles being put on road should carry also the responsibility of protecting the interests of the innocent victims of hit and run motor accidents.
A sum of Rs.5,000 and a sum of Rs.1,000 provided as compensation in respect of death or grievous hurt respectively appear to be highly inadequate.
The Government may consider whether these figures should not be increased in an appropriate manner.
Lastly we come to section 166 of the Bill which corresponds to section 110A of the present Act.
This con tains the provisions relating to application for compensa tion to be filed before Claims Tribunals.
It is stated therein that where death has resulted from the accident an application for compensation may be 1163 made by all or any of the legal representatives of the deceased.
The expression 'legal representative ' has not been defined in the Act and it has led to serious doubts in the course of judicial proceedings.
Attention of the Government is drawn to the decision of this Court in Gujarat State Road Transport Corporation, Ahmedabad vs Ramanbhai Prabhatbhai and Another, ; and the reference made in the said decision to the Report of the English Royal Commission on Civil Liberty and Compensation for Personal Injury under the Chairmanship of Lord Pearson.
The Government may consid er whether it would not be advisable to define the expres sion 'legal representative ' for purposes of making claims before Claims Tribunal where death had resulted from a motor vehicle accident in the same way in which the English Law has been amended.
Since the Bill is on the anvil of Parlia ment we feel that this is the appropriate time for the Central Government to reconsider the above issues.
A copy of this Order may be sent to the Secretary to the Government of India, Ministry of Transport, for information.
N.P.V. Petition dismissed.
","The petitioner was the owner of a bus being run as a stage carriage.
On 24.7.78 while carrying passengers this bus met with an accident, as a result of which one passenger died.
The Motor Accident Claims Tribunal held that the accident took place due to the negligence on the part of the driver and awarded compensation of Rs.56,800 to the legal representatives of the deceased.
It further held that the liability of the insurer to indemnify the petitioner was limited to Rs.5,000 as the policy specifically limited the insurer 's liability to what had been provided by section 95(2)(b)(ii)(2) and (4) of .
The appeal filed by the Petitioner was dismissed by the High Court.
In the Special Leave Petition before this Court, it was contended on behalf of the petitioner that the insurer was liable to indemnify the petitioner upto a limit of Rs.75,000 under section 95(2)(b)(ii)(2) of the and that the further limit mentioned in section 95(2)(b) (ii)(4) was inapplicable to the case of the petitioner.
Dismissing the Special Leave Petition, this Court, HELD: 1.
Having regard to the as it stood prior to the amendments by Act 47 of 1982.
the insurer was liable to pay upto Rs.10,000 for each individual passenger where the vehicle involved was a motor cab and upto Rs.5,000 for each individual passenger in any other case.
[1161F] 2.1 Section 95(2)(b) as it existed before its amendment in 1982 1150 dealt with the limits of the liability of an insurer in the case of motor vehicles in which passengers were carried for hire or reward or by reason of or in pursuance of a contract of employment.
[1155H; 1156A] Sub clause (i) of section 95(2)(b) provided that in respect of death of or injury to persons other than passen gers carried for hire or reward, a limit of Rs.50,000 in all was the limit of the liability of the insurer.
[1156A] Under sub clause (ii) there were two specific limits on the liability of the insurer in the case of motor vehicles carrying passengers.
The first limit related to the aggre gate liability of the insurer in any one accident.
It was fixed at Rs.50,000 in all where the vehicle was registered to carry not more than thirty passengers, at Rs.75,000 in all where the vehicle was registered to carry more than thirty but not more than sixty passengers and at Rs.1,00,000 in all where the vehicle was registered to carry more than sixty passengers.
The other limit was in respect of each passenger, which provided that subject to the limits afore said as regards the aggregate liability, the liability extended up to Rs.10,000 for each individual passenger where the vehicle was a motor cab and Rs.5,000 for each individual passenger in any other case.
Neither of the two limits can be ignored.
[1156B D] 2.2 The limit prescribed in section 95(2)(b)(ii)(4) cannot be said to be only the minimum liability prescribed by law.
The amount mentioned in that provision provides the maximum amount payable by an insurer in respect of each passenger who has suffered on account of an accident.
This is a fair construction of section 95(2) of the Act as it existed at the time when the accident took place.
[1156E] 2.3 After the 1982 amendment the liability of the insur er in respect of each individual passenger is Rs.15,000 as against Rs.10,000 in the case of each individual passenger where the vehicle was a motor cab and Rs.5,000 for each individual passenger in other cases, prior to the said amendment.
This shows that Parliament never intended that the aggregate liability of the insurer mentioned in sub clauses (1), (2) and (3) of section 95(2)(b)(ii) would be the liability of the insurer even when one passenger had died or suffered injury on account of an accident.
Such liability was always further limited by sub clause (4) of section 95(2)(b)(ii).
[1159F G] 2.4 In the instant case, the vehicle in question being a bus carrying passengers for hire or reward registered to carry more than thirty 1151 but not more than sixty passengers, the limit of the aggre gate liability of the insurer in any one accident was Rs.75,000 and subject to the said limit the liability in respect of each passenger was Rs.5,000.
[1156D] 2.5 As the law stands today the insurer is liable to pay upto Rs.15,000 in respect of death of any passenger or any injury caused to him.
Having regard to the large number of motor vehicle accidents which are taking place on roads and also to the fact that a large number of public service vehicles carrying passengers are involved in them, limit of Rs.15,000 fixed in the case of each passenger appears to be still meagre.
[1159E; 1160E] 3.
The following suggestions in respect of certain provisions of the are made for considera tion of the Central Government: (i) The limits of compensation in respect of death or permanent disablement payable in the event of there being no proof of fault have become unrealistic in view of inflation ary pressures and consequent loss of purchasing power of the rupee.
These limits should, therefore, be raised adequately.
[1162B C] (ii) There is no justification for continuing the dis tinction between public service vehicles and other vehicles and also between passengers and third parties with regard to the liability of the insurer to pay compensation.
Even among the public service vehicles a distinction is made between vehicles used as goods carriages and those used for carrying passengers.
It may be considered whether it is necessary to continue these distinctions and also whether the limits of liability of the insurer should not be altered suitably.
[1162D E] (iii) The society and the State which are responsible for a large number of motor vehicles being put on road should carry also the responsibility of protecting the interests of innocent victims of hit and run motor accidents which are increasing in number.
The amounts of Rs.5,000 and Rs.1,000 provided as compensation in respect of death or grievous hurt respectively appear to be highly inadequate.
It may be considered whether these figures should not be increased in an appropriate manner.
[1162F G] (iv) The expression ""legal representative"" has not been defined in the Act and it has led to serious doubts in the course of judicial proceedings.
It may be considered whether it would not be advisable to define the said expression for purposes of making claims before Claims 1152 Tribunals where death has resulted from a motor vehicle accident in the same way in which the English Law has been amended.

</s>","  The petitioner was the owner of a bus bearing No. KLD 9327 which was being run as a stage carriage.
On 24.7.1978 while the said bus was carrying passengers it met with an accident and Saheeda, who was one of the passengers in the bus, died as a consequence of the said accident.
The accident took place, according to the Motor Accidents Claims Tribunal, due to the negligence on the part of the driver of the vehicle who had been employed by the petitioner.
The Tribunal found that the compensation payable by the petitioner to the legal representatives of Saheeda was Rs.56,800.
It, however, held that the liability of the insurer to indemnify the petitioner was limited to Rs.5,000 as the policy specifically limited the insurer's liability to what had been provided by section 95(2)(b)(ii)(2) and (4) of the Act.
Aggrieved by the decision of the Tribunal the petitioner filed an appeal before the High Court of Kerala.
The said appeal was dismissed.
This petition is filed under Article 136 of the Constitution for special leave to appeal against the judgment of the High Court.
The contention of the petitioner before this Court is that the insurer was liable to indemnify the petitioner upto a limit of Rs.75,000 under section 95(2)(b)(ii)(2) of the Act and that the further limit mentioned in section 95(2)(b)(ii)(4) of the Act was inapplicable to the case of the petitioner.
The relevant part of section 95 of the Act during the relevant time read as follows: ""95(2).
Subject to the proviso to sub section (1), a policy of insurance shall cover any liability incurred in respect of any one accident up to the following limits, namely (a) where the vehicle is a goods vehicle, a limit of fifty thousand rupees in all, including the liabilities, if any, arising under the (8 of 1923), in respect of the death of, or bodily injury to, employees (other than the driver), not exceeding six in number, being carried in the vehicle; (b) where the vehicle is a vehicle in which passengers are carried for hire or reward or by reason of or in pursuance of a contract of employment, (i) in respect of persons other than passengers carried for hire or reward, a limit of fifty thousand rupees in all; (ii) in respect of passengers, (1) a limit of fifty thousand rupees in all where the vehicle is registered to carry not more than thirty passengers; (2) a limit of seventy five thousand rupees in all where the vehicle is registered to carry more than thirty but not more than sixty passengers; (3) a limit of one lakh rupees in all where the vehicle is registered to carry more than sixty passengers; and (4) subject to the limits aforesaid, ten thousand rupees for each individual passenger where the vehicle is a motor cab, and five thousand rupees for each individual passenger in any other case; (c) save as provided in clause (d), where the vehicle is a vehicle of any other class, the amount of liability incurred; (d) irrespective of the class of the vehicle, a limit of rupees two thousand in all in respect of damage to any property of a third party.
Section 95 of the Act sets out the requirements of the policies of insurance which must be taken by the owners of motor vehicles and the limits of liabilities thereunder.
A policy of insurance should subject to the proviso to sub section (1) of section 95 of the Act cover any liability incurred in respect of any one accident upto the limits specified in sub section (2) of section 95 of the Act.
Clause (a) of section 95(2) of the Act during the relevant time provided that where the vehicle was a goods vehicle the policy should cover the liability upto Rs.50,000 in all including the liabilities, if any, arising under the Workmen's Compensation Act, 1923, in respect of the death of, or bodily injury to, employees (other than the driver), not exceeding six in number, being carried in the vehicle.
The petitioner contended that the policy issued by the respondent insurer covered the liability upto Rs.75,000 in all including the liabilities, if any, arising under the Workmen's Compensation Act, 1923, in respect of the death of, or bodily injury to, employees (other than the driver), not exceeding six in number, being carried in the vehicle.
He submitted that the policy did not contain any specific limitation on the liability in respect of the death of, or bodily injury to, employees (other than the driver), not exceeding six in number, being carried in the vehicle.
He also submitted that the policy did not provide for any deduction from the liability in respect of the death of, or bodily injury to, employees (other than the driver), not exceeding six in number, being carried in the vehicle.
The petitioner relied upon the decision of this Court in State Bank of India vs Union of India & Ors., ; AIR 1971 SC 2001, to contend that the policy should be construed in favour of the insured and against the insurer.
He also relied upon the decision of this Court in State Bank of India vs Union of India & Ors., ; AIR 1971 SC 2001, to contend that the policy should be construed in accordance with its terms and that the insurer could not take advantage of any ambiguity in the policy.
The petitioner also submitted that the policy was issued by the respondent insurer in accordance with the requirements of section 95 of the Act and that the respondent insurer was bound to indemnify the petitioner upto the limit of Rs.75,000 in all including the liabilities, if any, arising under the Workmen's Compensation Act, 1923, in respect of the death of, or bodily injury to, employees (other than the driver), not exceeding six in number, being carried in the vehicle.

University of Madras v. Shantha Bai, AIR 1954 Mad 67

","The primary dissenting argument in the University of Madras v. Shantha Bai case was that the regulations issued by the University restricting admission of women students in colleges without facilities were discriminatory and violated Article 15(1) of the Constitution. The dissenting opinion argued that the regulations imposed an unnecessary burden on women students and hindered their right to education. It contended that the regulations should have focused on ensuring equal access to education for all students, regardless of their gender. The dissenting judge believed that the regulations were not justified and that they perpetuated gender-based discrimination. The dissenting opinion emphasized the importance of promoting gender equality in education and criticized the majority's interpretation of Article 29(2) as allowing for discrimination based on sex. Overall, the dissenting arguments challenged the validity of the regulations and advocated for a more inclusive and non-discriminatory approach to admission in educational institutions.</s>","The University of Madras argued that it had the power to admit students from other universities and colleges under its jurisdiction, even if they did not meet the eligibility criteria for admission. The university contended that this power was necessary to ensure fairness and equality in admissions. However, the court held that the university's power to admit students from other universities was subject to the condition that they met the eligibility criteria laid down by the university itself. This decision limited the university's discretionary power in admitting students from other universities and emphasized the importance of following established rules and regulations. The dissenting argument was based on the interpretation of the university's powers and the need for flexibility in admissions. However, the majority opinion upheld the validity of the university's regulations and ensured that admissions were conducted fairly and according to established procedures.   It is important to note that the dissenting argument in this case was not explicitly stated or presented in the judgment. Therefore, there may be additional perspectives or reasoning that were not included in the court's decision-making process. Nonetheless, the primary dissenting argument centered around the university's power to admit students from other universities and the need for flexibility in admissions.   Overall, the decision in the University of Madras v. Shantha Bai case highlighted the importance of establishing clear and transparent rules and regulations in educational institutions. It emphasized the need for fairness and equality in admissions while also recognizing the role of discretionary powers in certain circumstances. While there may have been dissenting opinions or alternative perspectives, the majority opinion upheld the validity of the university's regulations and ensured that admissions were conducted in accordance with established procedures."

The case Indra Sawhney v. Union of India AIR 1993 SC 477

","The case of Indra Sawhney v. Union of India has several potential human rights implications. Firstly, it addresses the right to equality under Articles 14, 16(1), and 16(4) of the Constitution. The court's decision upholding the validity of reservation in promotions for SCs/STs recognizes the historical disadvantage faced by these communities and their right to representation in public services. This decision ensures that the human rights of SCs/STs to equal opportunities and non-discrimination are protected.

Secondly, the case also highlights the potential tension between the right to equality and the right to equal opportunities for all citizens. The court's imposition of a 50% limit on reservation in promotions aims to strike a balance between the rights of reserved category candidates and the need to maintain administrative efficiency. This limitation ensures that the human rights of all citizens, including those from the general category, are not unduly compromised.

Furthermore, the case raises the issue of social justice and affirmative action. By upholding the reservation policy, the court recognizes the importance of addressing historical discrimination and promoting social inclusion. This decision aligns with the human rights principles of equality, non-discrimination, and the right to development.

Overall, the case of Indra Sawhney v. Union of India has significant human rights implications as it safeguards the rights of marginalized communities, balances competing rights, and promotes social justice and inclusion.</s>","The case Indra Sawhney v. Union of India has several potential human rights implications. Firstly, it highlights the right to equality under Article 14 of the Indian Constitution. The Supreme Court's decision in this case upheld the validity of reservation for Scheduled Castes (SCs) and Scheduled Tribes (STs) in promotions, which ensures equal opportunities for marginalized communities. This recognition of the right to equality is crucial in addressing historical discrimination and promoting social justice.

Secondly, the case emphasizes the importance of affirmative action policies aimed at uplifting disadvantaged groups. Reservation in promotions is a form of affirmative action that seeks to redress past discrimination and provide opportunities for marginalized communities to access higher positions. By recognizing the need for reservation, the court acknowledges the inherent inequality faced by SCs/STs and takes steps towards rectifying it.

Furthermore, the case also touches upon the right to life and dignity under Article 21 of the Constitution. The court's decision ensures that SCs/STs have access to employment opportunities and can reach higher positions without facing discrimination or barriers. This recognition of the right to life and dignity is essential in promoting inclusivity and combating discrimination.

Overall, the case Indra Sawhney v. Union of India has significant human rights implications by recognizing the right to equality, affirmative action policies, and the right to life and dignity. It contributes to the protection and promotion of human rights in India by addressing historical discrimination and ensuring equal opportunities for marginalized communities."

G. Ramaswamy, Additional Solicitor General, U.J. Mukhi ja, B.S. Basania, Mrs. A.K. Verma, Arun Banga and D.N. Misra for the Respondent.
The Judgment of the Court was delivered by SABYASACHI MUKHARJI, J.
This is an appeal by special leave from the judgment and order dated 19th November, 1986 of the learned Single Judge of the Bombay High Court.
In this appeal this Court has been asked to examine the fron tiers of judicial review of the action of a statutory au thority, i.e. the Board of Trustees of the Port of Bombay, in evicting its tenant and granting the land in question to another tenant.
However, in order to appreciate the contro versy it is necessary to have a conspectus of the facts involved.
756 The respondent Board of Trustees of the Port of Bombay is a statutory authority.
Vast areas of South Bombay which are completely tenanted, are owned by the respondent.
Being a statutory authority, the respondent has been exempted from the operation of the relevant Rent Act.
The respondent is a statutory corporation constituted under the Major Port Trust Act, 1963 as amended by the Major Port Trust (Amendment) Act, 1974.
Between about 1906 and 1932, one Jhunjhunwala was the lessee of plot No. 6 (which adjoins plot 5B which is the suit plot) and a building was existing on plot No. 6 which was tenanted to M/s Bombay Bharat & Swadeshi Rice Mills, and the said Mills were desirous of operating a rice mill on plot No. 6 but could not get the licence from the Municipal ity for the operation of the said rice mill unless satisfac tory arrangement was made for the removal and storage of rice husk in a separate chamber/structure.
Since about 1932, the appellant had been the lessee of the respondent in respect of part of the original plot No. 4 (now plot 5B) which adjoins plot No. 6 of the suit plot measuring 113.4 sq. rots.
In or about 1933 34, with a view to acquire the suit plot and using the same for the rice mill/dust room, M/s Bombay Bharat & Swadeshi Rice Mills took over the appellant.
The dust room structure was constructed on the suit plot.
The rice mill on plot No. 6 and the dust room on the suit plot had a common wall and were inter connected by ducts.
It was stated that the respondent 's inspectors had regularly visited the premises in question but had never objected to the user of the rice mill/dust room.
In Decem ber '57, the Town Planning Scheme No. 1 in Bombay City came into force.
The original plot No. 4 was reconstituted into final plot No. 5 but continued to belong to the respondent.
The Scheme also stipulated that all rights of lessee/tenants in the original plots stood transferred to the final plots.
It may be noted that in December '57 original plot No. 4 comprised of 113.4 sq.
let to the appellant, 390 sq.
let to M/s Dhanji Mavji, 453 sq.
let to two asso ciate firms (M/s Gordhandas Ranchoddas and M/s Chunilal Gupta) and 195 sq. mts.
let to M/s Vassanji Hirji.
Hence, of the final plot No. 5, the appellant and their associates, it was asserted, held 569 sq. mts.
, Dhanji Mavji held 390, Vassanji Hirji held 195 sq. rots.
and the balance 155 sq.
was with the respondent/others.
Total area of final plot 5 was 1309 sq. mts.
From 1957 72, the respondent, it is asserted, continued the tenancies of the appellant and its associate firms.
In or about 1963, however, the respondent applied for and got final plot No. 5 sub divided into final plot 5A (659 sq. mts.) 757 and final plot 5B (650 sq. mts.).
The suit plot and M/s Dhanji Mavji 's plot fell entirely in final plot 5B and as a result of the sub division, Dhanji Mavji became the tenant/occupant of a major portion of plot 5B.
It is assert ed that appellant 's associate firm and Chunilal Gupta fell in plot No. 5A and became the tenants/occupants of a major portion of plot No. 5A.
In 197 1 the Municipality renewed the mill licence covering both the structures.
It is the case of the appellant that in 1970 71, the respondent arbitrarily agreed to let the entire plot 5B including the portion which had been let to and in the possession of the appellant since 1933 to M/s. Dhanji Mavji, and thereby agreed to give him 650.6 sq.
mrs. against his existing 390 sq. mts.
Also the appellant offered to develop final plot 5B jointly with Dhanji Mavji in 1972 76.
The appellant, however, asserted that it had offered to pay the revised rent that might be fixed by the respondent.
The appellant objected to the offer made to Dhanji Mavji exclu sively and pointed out that the established practice of the respondent was to continue the existing tenants/ occupants on the final plots.
The respondent, however, asserted that as Dhanji Mavji had been in possession of the major portion of plot No. 5B (390 sq.
vis a vis 113.4 sq. mts.), they agreed to let the entire plot to Dhanji Mavji and, there fore, could not entertain the appellant 's request.
In the premises, by notices issued in 197 1 73, the respondent purported to terminate the tenancy of the appellant.
In 1973 74, the Municipal Corporation auctioned the right, title and interest of Jhunjhunwala and the respondent in plot No. 6 for nonpayment of property taxes.
An associate firm of the appellant M/s. Natwar Parekh & Sons purchased plot No. 6 and became the owner thereof.
The case of the appellant was that the respondent got the Corporation to wrongfully exclude the respondent 's interest from the con veyance.
The said Natwar Parekh challenged such exclusion by filing writ petition No. 52/74 in the High Court.
On 26.7.1976, the writ petition was allowed, and Natwar Parekh are now the owners of plot No. 6.
This, according to the appellant, caused resentment to the respondent, and it offered Plot No. 5A to the existing tenants, i.e. the peti tioner 's associates who held 453 sq.
and Vassanji Hirji, who held 195 sq.
The petitioner 's associates who held 70% of the plot 5A, pointed out that the said Vassanji Hirji was not interested and that the entire plot should accordingly be given to them.
The respondents declined and instead commenced eviction proceedings against all the three holders.
In or about October 1977, the respondent issued one month 's notice to the appellant to terminate the tenancy.
In December, 1977 the respondent filed suits Nos. 447 & 603/77 against the appellant in the Court of Small Causes, Bombay.
The 758 appellant filed its written statement and pleaded that the proceedings had been instituted mala fide and just to bene fit Dhanji Mavji and to harass the appellant 's associates, who had acquired the respondent 's title to plot No. 6.
Secondly, it was asserted that the premises had been ac quired and used for rice mill for 40 years and accordingly it could not be terminated by one month notice.
The lease was for manufacturing purposes.
Thirdly, it was asserted, that the notice of termination, in any event, had been waived by demanding and recovering rent/ enhanced rent.
It is asserted that at the hearing the witnesses of the respondent had admitted that the plot would be given to Dhanji Mavji if the appellant was evicted therefrom.
It also agreed that the respondent was under no statutory obligation to give the entire plot to Dhanji Mavji.
On or about 31st March, 1981 the Trial Court dismissed the suit, holding that the appellant was admittedly using the plot for a rice mill for over 50 years to the knowledge of the respondent; and it would be legitimate to infer that the letting was for a manufacturing purpose.
Hence, the notice of termination was bad.
The Trial Court did not deal with the question of mala fide.
On or about 13th January, 1984 the appellate court reversed that decision and also held that the issue of mala fide or arbitrariness was not relevant on the legality of the eviction proceedings.
Ag grieved thereby, the appellant filed a writ petition No. 710/84 under Article 227 of the Constitution.
The High Court dismissed the said writ petition by the judgment under appeal and upheld the order of eviction.
The High Court accepted the finding of the appellate court that the notice of ejectment was valid notice and there was no waiver of notice.
In our opinion, the High Court was right on this aspect and in any event under Article 227 of the Constitu tion the High Court could not have gone into this question.
We, in an appeal under Article 136 of the Constitution cannot re appraise that question.
The question that survived after the finding of the appellate court and which was urged mainly before the High Court and also in this appeal, was whether the action of the respondent in evicting the appellant and granting the prem ises in question to M/s Dhanji Mavji was proper and right.
It was contended on behalf of the appellant that the action of the respondent in terminating the appellant 's contractual tenancy had a public law character attached to it and was accordingly subject to judicial review.
It was asserted that every action of the respondent which was 'State ' within Article 12 of the Constitution, whether it be in the field of contract, or any other field, was subject to Article 14 of the Constitution and must be reasonable and taken only 759 upon lawful and relevant grounds of public interest.
In that light, it was urged that if the eviction of the appellant was not necessary in the public interest and if it had been taken pursuant to any norm or policy which does not permit eviction of the appellant, then the action is arbitrary and discriminatory and not in accordance with any policy which the respondent was enjoined to follow.
In the aforesaid background it was contended that the eviction of the appellant was not necessary in public inter est.
It appears that the eviction of the appellant was only in pursuance of a policy of the Port Trust to let out a reconstituted plot to the person who occupied the major portion and who could use it for development.
It was urged that the decision of the Port Trust to allot the entire plot to M/s Dhanji Mavji to the exclusion of the appellant (although the appellant was thereof for the past 40 years) was an arbitrary and discriminatory departure from the established policy of the Port Trust, which was to offer the plot to the existing tenants (where two or more tenants were in occupation of one plot) as joint tenants.
It was contend ed that the impugned termination was ultra vires and arbi trary.
It was contended that the exclusive allotment of the entire plot 5B to M/s Dhanji Mavji and the consequent termi nation of the appellant 's tenancy was not necessary to enable proper development of the plot as required by the Town Planning Scheme.
There was no policy requiring the entire final/reconstituted plot to be allotted exclusively to the person occupying the major portion thereof or requir ing the other existing occupants to be evicted.
Nor, it was submitted, was the allotment of the entire plot, pursuant to any such alleged policy.
On the other hand, the appellant contended that the respondent 's established policy was to offer/allot a final/ reconstituted plot for development to the existing occupants thereof as joint tenants.
It was contended that this rational policy which, according to the appellant, would have fulfilled the public interest of development in accordance with the regulations of the Town Planning Scheme and at the same time would not have required or necessitated the eviction of the existing occupants.
Contrary to the established rational policy of accommo dating tenants by offering/allotting a new plot jointly to the existing occupants/tenants, the respondent arbitrarily, it was contended, and discriminatingly did not offer the new plot 5B to M/s Dhanji Mavji and the appellant (both of whom were existing tenants/occupants of the plot) as joint ten ants, but instead wrongfully decided to give the entire plot to M/s Dhanji Mavji to the exclusion of the appellant.
""Our attention was drawn to Section 4 of the Bombay Rents, Hotel & Lodging House Rates (Control) Act, 1947, which enjoins that 760 the Act would not apply to the premises belonging to the Govt.
or to the local authorities.
By the provisions of the said Section 4, the Port Authorities were exempted from the operation of the Rent Act.
This privilege was given to the Port Trust Authorities, it was submitted, on the assumption that it would act in public interest, and would not behave like ordinary landlords.
The special privileges, powers and benefits were statutorily conferred on the Bombay Port Trust by Section (4) of the aforesaid Act.
It had those rights due to its statutory or public character, as a local authority.
Our attention was also drawn to the decision in Rampra tap Jaidayal vs Dominion of India, at 934 where the Chief Justice Chagla observed as follows: ""It is not too much to assume, as the Legisla ture did in this case assume, that the very Government whose object was to protect the tenants and prevent rent being increased and prevent people being ejected, would not itself when it was the landlord do those very things which it sought to prohibit its people from doing, and therefore the underlying assumption of this exemption is that Government would not increase rents and would not eject tenants unless it was absolutely necessary in public interest and unless a particular building was required for a public purpose."" This Court in Baburao Shantaram More vs The Bombay Housing Board & Anr., [1954] V SCR 572 had to consider Section 4 of the Bombay Rents, Hotel & Lodging House Rates Control Act, 1947, and so far as material for our present purposes explained the basis of exemption under Section 4 as that the Govt.
or local authority or the Board would not be actuated by any profit making motive so as to unduly enhance the rents or eject the tenants from their respective proper ties as private landlords are or are likely to be.
In other words, this Court recognised that the basis of differentia tion in favour of the public authorities like the respond ent, was on the ground that they would not act for their own purpose as private landlords do, but must act for public purpose. 'Our attention was also drawn by Mr Chinai, learned counsel for the appellant, to the observations on 'Adminis trative Law by Wade, 5th Edn.
at page 355.
It was stated therein as follows: ""Statutory power conferred for public pur poses is conferred as it were upon trust, not absolutely that is to say, it can validly be used only in the right and proper way which Parliament when conferring it is presumed to have intended.
"" 761 It, therefore, follows that the public authorities which enjoy this benefit without being hidebound by the require ments of the Rent Act must act for public benefit.
Hence, to that extent, this is liable to be gone into and can be the subject matter of adjudication.
Learned Addl.
Solicitor General Mr Ramaswami contended that the onus was entirely on the appellant and the burden lay on the defendant to establish that the Bombay Port Trust had terminated the tenancy or taken the proceedings in eviction not in public interest but for a collateral purpose or mala fide or that it had acted in a manner contrary to the provisions of article 14 of the Constitution.
He is right so contending.
It was further urged by Mr Ramaswamy that public law duties are owed to society at large and the nature of the body performing the functions is not determinative of public law or private law character of the action taken.
He con tended that since the provisions of the Bombay Rent Act did not apply to the premises of the Bombay Port Trust in the notice of termination no reason was required to be given either in the notice itself terminating the tenancy or in the plaint for evicting the appellant.
He further contended that originally the Bombay Port Trust was constituted as a body corporate under the provisions of the Bombay Port Trust Act, 1889 and is now constituted under the provisions of the Major Port Trusts Acts, 1988.
In both these Statutes the object for constituting the Bombay Port Trust was not to provide accommodation to persons and, therefore, the object was totally different from the object for which the Bombay Rent Act and similar enactments have been enacted.
It was, therefore, urged that since there was no obligation or duty cast upon the Bombay Port Trust to provide accommodation, there could be no question of acting in Government charac ter.
It was urged that the respondent did not enjoy any special privileges/powers of benefits vis a vis such activi ties by virtue of its being a local Body or Government character.
In the premises, it was contended that such a body stands on the same footing as any other citizen and will, in respect of such activity, not be subjected to public law duty.
We are unable to accept the submissions.
Being a public body even in respect of its dealing with its tenant, it must act in public interest, and an infraction of that duty is amenable to examination either in civil suit or in writ jurisdiction.
Our attention was drawn to the observations of this Court in Radhakrishna Agarwal & Ors.
vs State of Bihar & Ors.
, ; Reliance was also placed on the observations of this Court in Life 762 Insurance Corpn.
of India vs Escorts Ltd. & Ors., ; , in support of the contention that the public corporations ' dealing with tenants is a contractual dealing and it is not a matter for public law domain and is not subject to judicial review.
However, it is not the correct position.
The Escorts ' decision reiterated that every action of the State 'or an instrumentality of the State, must be informed by reason.
Indubitably, the respondent is an organ of the State under article 12 of the Constitution.
In appropri ate cases, as was observed in the last mentioned decision, actions uninformed by reason may be questioned as arbitrary in proceedings under article 226 or article 32 of the Constitu tion.
But it has to be remembered that article 14 cannot be construed as a charter for judicial review of State action, to call upon the State to account for its actions in its manifold activities by stating reasons for such actions.
The contractual privileges are made immune from the protection of the Rent Act for the respondent because of the public position occupied by the respondent authority.
Hence, its actions are amenable to judicial review only to the extent that the State must act validly for a discernible reason not whimsically for any ulterior purpose.
Where any special right or privilege is granted to any public or statutory body on the presumption that it must act in cer tain manner, such bodies must make good such presumption while acting by virtue of such privileges.
Judicial review to oversee if such bodies are so acting is permissible.
The field of letting and eviction of tenants is normally governed by the Rent Act.
The Port Trust is statutorily exempted from the operation of Rent Act on the basis of its public/Government character.
The legislative assumption or expectation as noted in the observations of Chagla C.J. in Rampratap Jaidayal 's case (supra) cannot make such conduct a matter of contract pure and simple.
These corporations must act in accordance with certain constitutional conscience and whether they have so acted, must be discernible from the conduct of such corporations.
In this connection, reference may be made on the observations of this Court in S.P. Rekhi vs Union of India, ; , reiterated in M.C. Mehta & Anr.
vs Union of India & Ors.
, [1987] 1 SCC 395, wherein at p. 148, this Court observed: ""It is dangerous to exonerate corporations from the need to have constitutional con science; and so, that interpretation, language permitting, which makes governmental agencies, whatever their mien amenable to constitutional limitations must be adopted by the court as against the alternative of permitting them to flourish as an imperium in imperio.
"" 763 Therefore, Mr Chinai was right in contending that every action activity of the Bombay Port Trust which constituted ""State"" within article 12 of the Constitution in respect of any right conferred or privilege granted by any Statute is subject to article 14 and must be reasonable and taken only upon lawful and relevant grounds of public interest.
Reli ance may be placed on the observations of this Court in E.P. Royappa vs State of Tamil Nadu, ; ; Maneka Gandhi vs Union .of
India, [1978] 2 SCR 621; R.D. Shetty vs The International Airport Authority of India & Ors., ; ; Kasturi Lal Lakshmi Reddy vs State of J & K & Anr., ; and Ajay Hasia vs Khalid Mujib Sehravardi & Ors. etc.
; , Where there is arbitrariness in State action, article 14 springs in and judi cial review strikes such an action down.
Every action of the Executive Authority must be subject to rule of law and must be informed by reason.
So,, whatever be the activity of the public authority, it should meet the test of article 14.
The observations in paras 101 & 102 of the Escorts ' case (supra) read properly do not detract from the aforesaid principles.
The High Court had relied on the observations of this Court in Kasturi Lal Lakshrni Reddy vs State of Jammu & Kashmir & Anr., (supra) that the State was not totally freed of the duty to act fairly and rationally, merely because it could do so under a contract.
The High Court stated that though it might be accepted that a public body like the respondent should not act unreasonably or unfairly but it did not follow that every time they decided to take action against the contractual tenants, they had to decide the said action in terms of fairness, equity and good faith.
In support of this proposition, reliance was placed on the observations of this Court in L.I.C vs Escorts, (supra).
In this connection, Mr Chinai appearing for the appellant reiterated before us as he did before the High Court, that the basis of the legitimate assumption or expectation of which the statutory exemption had been granted by the Legis lature to the Bombay Port Trust provided a guideline or touch stone by which the conduct of the public authority which had been granted exemption, should be judged.
And, according to him, the necessity of eviction in the instant case, must have been only in public interest.
Reliance was placed on several decisions referred to hereinbefore.
We are inclined to accept the submission that every activity of a public authority especially in the background of the assumption on which such authority enjoys immunity from the rigours of the Rent Act, must be informed by reason and guided by the public interest.
All exercise of discre tion or power by public authorities as the respondent, in respect of dealing with tenants in respect of which they have been treated separately and distinctly from other landlords on the assump 764 tion that they would not act as private landlords must be judged by that standard.
If a governmental policy or action even in contractual matters fails to satisfy the test of reasonableness, it would be unconstitutional.
See the obser vations of this Court in Kasturi Lal Lakshrni Reddy, (supra) and R.D. Shettv vs The International Airport Authoritv of India & Ors., ; at 1034.
Learned Additional Solicitor General reiterated on behalf of the respondent that no question of mala fide had been alleged or proved in these proceedings.
Factually, he is right.
But it has to be borne in mind that governmental policy would be invalid as lacking in public interest, unreasonable or contrary to the professed standards and this is different from the fact that it was not done bona fide.
It is true as learned Addl.
Solicitor General contended that there is always a presumption that a governmental action is reasonable and in public interest.
It is for the party challenging its validity to show that the action is unrea sonable, arbitrary or contrary to the professed norms or not informed by public interest, and the burden is a heavy one.
In this background the contention of the appellant has been that its eviction was not necessary in public interest, and further that the eviction was only in pursuance of an alleged policy on the part of the Port Trust to let out the reconstituted plot to the person who occupied the major portion, which, according to the appellant, was not in consonance with the obligation of the Trust to take action only in public interest.
It was contended that eviction for development with least dislocation, should have been the aim and that would have served the public purpose better.
On behalf of the appellant it was contended that before the Trial Court it was established that both the appellant and M/s Dhanji Mavji had been tenants of the Port Trust on the original plot No. 4 since 1932, and in fact the appellant was older tenant.
Our attention was drawn to para 16 of the appellant 's written statement, Vol.
2 Paper Book, page 35.
In this context, it was submitted that the decision of the Port Trust was not based on public purpose/interest, and as such was ultra vires of the powers of the Port Trust.
It was contended that such a plea was justiciable in all civil suits.
On behalf of the Port Trust authorities, however, the submission was that there was no obligation under the Bombay Port Trust Act to provide accommodation.
So, there cannot be any governmental character.
This we have already dealt with.
Learned Add|.
Solicitor General submitted that in evi dence it has been mentioned by Katara (P.W. 1 at page 43, Vol.
II) that the plot had been allotted to Dhanji Mavji since it was the policy of the Bombay Port Trust to allot a re constituted plot to a person occupying 765 a major portion of such plot.
There was no challenge to this evidence .in cross examination.
On the other hand, he con tended that there was no evidence on the alleged policy of the Port Trust of giving plots on joint tenancy to all occupants.
According to him, in the letters addressed by the Port Trust at pp. 82, 123, 128 of Vol. 1 and in the letters by and on behalf of the appellant and/or their alleged associate concerns at pp.
14 1 to 147 they have specifically admitted that there was a policy of the Port Trust to allot plots to the occupants of the major portions thereof and in fact a grievance has been made by them that in accordance with the said policy of the Bombay Port Trust, Plot No. 5A was not being allotted to the associates of the appellant.
In that view of the matter even under the scope of judicial review, it was contended, whether it should have been given on joint tenancies or not, is not a matter which could be gone into by the Court.
Reliance was placed on the observa tions of Lord Justice Diplock in Council of Civil Service Unions vs Minister for the Civil Service, at 950, where the learned Lord Justice classified 8 grounds subject to control of judicial review, namely, illegali ty, irrationality and procedural impropriety.
Learned Addl.
Solicitor General is right, in our opinion, in that we cannot really substitute a decision reached by a fair proce dure keeping the policy of the respondent in mind by a different decision only on the ground that the decision which appeals to the court, is a better one.
Reliance was placed on the observations of Lord Chancellor Lord Hailsham in Chief Constable of the North Wales Police vs Evans, ; In our opinion, it is necessary to remem ber that judicial review, in the words of Lord Brightman in that case, is not concerned with the decision, but with the decision making process.
As observed by Prof. Dias in 'Juri sprudence ' (5th Edn.
at p. 91) unless the restriction on the power of the court is observed, the court would under the guise of preventing the abuse of power, be itself guilty of usurping power which does not belong to it.
It is therefore necessary to bear in mind the ways and means by which the court can control or supervise the judicial action of any authority which is subject to judicial control.
In this connection, it is necessary to refer to the observations of Lord Justice Templeman in re Preston vs I.R.C., and the observations of Lord Justice May in Regina vs Chief Constable of the Merseyside Police, It is not within the purview of a court to substitute a decision taken by a constituted authority simply because the decision sought to be substituted is a better one.
Learned Addl.
Solicitor General, in our opinion, is therefore right in contending that the appellant should not be allowed to contend that the decision of the Bombay Port Trust to allot the plot to the major holder is not one of the feasible means of achieving the objectives of development.
It was not open to the appellant to contend 766 that the Bombay Port Trust could have framed a better policy in a way in which both the goals, development and non evic tion of existing tenants, could have been achieved.
Furthermore, we have to bear in mind that joint allot ment for the purpose of development pre supposes coopera tion.
In this connection, it is necessary to remember that Mr Singhvi, appearing for the intervener, in C.M.P. No. 19447/88 indicated that the joint development was not possi ble because they were not willing to take it jointly.
He also pointed out that the appellant was aware that the decision to allot this plot in his client 's favour had been taken as early as 1973 and that it was within the knowledge of the present appellant that they had also put up construc tions thereon at substantial cost.
He urged that, though it is true that the lease in favour of the petitioner was terminated and the suit filed only in 1977, the fact is that the appellant took no step earlier to have the allotment in favour of his clients cancelled.
This, he has urged, is also a ground for non interference at this stage.
We are inclined to agree.
Our attention was drawn to the fact that Dhanji Mavji had held 80% of the re constituted plot.
The plot 5B had been developed inasmuch as a building of ground plus 5 upper storeys had been erected as was the maximum possible not withstanding the fact that the appellant had not yet surren dered their portion.
As against this, on plot 5A where the Bombay Port Trust offered a joint tenancy to the three occupants, since there was no occupant holding a major portion thereof, there had been no development whatsoever and in fact there has been litigation going on to remove all the 3 occupants.
In that view of the matter the Bombay Port Trust, perhaps, was justified in coming to the conclusion that the only possible way to develop the properties of the Bombay Port Trust in compliance with the Town Planning Scheme by allotting plots to holders of major portions thereon.
Such a decision cannot be faulted.
The Town Planning Scheme came into force in 1957.
Plot 5 was divided into Plot 5A and 5B in 1963.
The Town Planning Act had been enacted to meet the requirements for planning, development and use of land.
Having regard to Sections 2(7), 2(13), 2(17), 2(18), 2(21), 2(22), 2(27), 13, 14, 22, 59, 65, 88, 89, & 159, it appears that one of the purposes was the extinguishment of the tenancies of the Port Trust, and as such tenants of plot 5A and 5B were liable to eviction.
The Port Trust continued them as monthly tenants for many years before formulating a policy to develop the plots by offering them to major holders.
In pursuance to that Scheme, regulations have been flamed under Section 169 of the Town Planning Act.
Our attention was placed on some of these regulations.
It is contended that it was viewed that 767 plot of land of less than 500 sq.
yards out of the Town Planning Scheme cannot be allotted.
In that view of the matter it is a possible view and we need not go beyond this.
In that context even though we reiterate that the Port Trust must act reasonably and in adherence to a policy which serves the public purpose on the assumption of which exemp tion was granted to it from the Rent Act, while dealing with the tenants or occupants, it cannot be said that the Port Trust has acted improperly.
In that light the decision of the High Court must be affirmed though on a different empha sis.
In the view that we have taken, it is not necessary for us to go into the question whether under article 227 of the Constitution, it was open to the High Court to go into the question of constitutional validity for which reliance was placed on the observations of this Court in Venkatlal G. Pittie & Anr.
vs Bright Bros (P) Ltd. ; at 569 and Khalil Ahmed Bashir Ahmed vs Tufelhussein Samasbhai Sarangpurwala, ; Reliance was also placed by Mr Chinai on the observations of the House of Lords in England in Wandsworth London Borough Council vs Winder, ; at 505 507.
In that case the local authority was under the agreement itself, required to fix rent under the statutory provision.
It committed a breach thereof.
Hence, it was held there that that was a breach of a con tractual obligation enforceable under the Private Law and, therefore, justiciable.
As we look upon the facts of this case, there was an implied obligation in respect of dealings with the tenants/occupants of the Port Trust authority to act in public interest/purpose That requirement is fulfilled if it is demonstrated that the Port Trust Authorities have acted in pursuance of a policy which is referable to public pur pose.
Once that norm is established whether that policy is the best policy or whether another policy was possible, is not relevant for consideration.
It is, therefore, not neces sary for our present purposes to dwell on the question whether the obligation of the Port Trust Authorities to act in pursuance of a public purpose was of public law purpose or a private law purpose.
Under the Constitutional scheme of this country the Port Trust Authorities were required by relevant law to act in pursuance of public purpose.
We are satisfied that they have proceeded to so act.
We must record that learned Addl.
Solicitor General made a statement that irrespective of the result of this appeal, the Port Trust Authorities of Bombay, will consider reasonably granting of an alternative site to the appellant, if such an application is made to them.
In the view that we have taken this appeal must, there fore, fail and is accordingly dismissed.
The C.M.P. No. 19447/88 is disposed of 768 by directing that the applicants are permitted to intervene and their submissions have been considered.
In the facts and the circumstances of the case, the parties will pay and bear their own costs.
All interim orders are vacated.
RANGANATHAN, J. I respectfully agree with the conclusion of my learned brother Sabyasachi Mukharji, J.
However, I would like to add a word of reservation.
The principal argument which Shri Chinai addressed to us at great length on behalf of appellant was that the relationship between the appellant and the Port Trust was not purely contractual and in the realm of private law.
He urged that the Port Trust, having been granted an exemption from the provisions of the rent control acts on certain public grounds, is not at liberty to take action to evict the petitioner without being accountable therefore and that its action is in the realm of public law and hence liable to judicial review.
He submitted that the decision of this Court in the Escorts case, , is not inconsistent with this contention.
The learned Additional Solicitor General contested the above proposition on principle and refuted the sugges tion that the Port Trust was under any obligation to show that its action was bona fide, and not arbitrary or unrea sonable but could be justified on grounds of public inter est.
He submitted that on the facts of the present case, the state of the pleadings at the various stages and its own findings on the facts, the High Court was not called upon to go into the larger issue at all and that its observations in this regard were purely casual.
He submitted, however, that, without prejudice to these contentions, he would be willing to satisfy us on the facts of the present case that the action of the Port Trust was bona fide and based on policy and reason.
He addressed us on this aspect and I agree, with respect, with the conclusion of my learned brother Sabyasachi Mukharji, J. that, on the facts of the present case, the action of the Port Trust was not improper and that there are no grounds to interfere with the same.
In view of the above conclusion on the merits and in view of my opinion that we have not heard full arguments on both sides on the general propositions contended for by Shri Chinai as to the parameters and scope of judicial review in such matters which are issues of far reaching importance, I would like to refrain from expressing any final and conclud ed opinion on these aspects though, prima facie, I am also inclined to think, as held by my learned brother that there is considerable force in them.
R.S.S. Appeal dismissed.
","The respondent Board of Trustees of the Port of Bombay is a statutory authority, and as such has been exempted from the operation of the Bombay Rents, Hotel & Lodging House Rates (Control) Act, 1947.
The appellant has been the lessee of the respondent since about 1932 in respect of part of the original plot No. 4 (now plot 5B) which adjoins plot No. 6 tenanted by M/s Bombay Bharat & Swadeshi Rice Mills.
In or about 1933 34, M/s Bombay Bharat & Swadeshi Rice Mills took over the appellant, and a rice mill was started on appel lant 's part of plot No. 4 and plot No. 6.
In December 1957, the Town Planning Scheme No. 1 in Bombay City came into force, and the original plot No. 4 was reconstituted into final plot No. 5.
In or about 1963 the respondent sub divided plot No. 5 into final plot 5A and final plot 5B, and as a result of the sub division M/s Dhanji Mavji became the tenant/occupant of a major portion of plot 5B, In 1970 71 the respondent agreed to let the entire plot 5B, including the portion which had been let to and was in possession of the appellant since 1933, to Dhanji Mavji.
The appellant objected to the offer made to Dhanji Mavji but the respondent asserted that as Dhanji Mavji had been in possession of the major portion of plot No. 5B, it agreed to let the entire plot to them.
In the premise, the respondent purported to terminate the tenancy of the appel lant in respect of its .
portion of plot 5B, and later filed suit for eviction.
The Trial Court dismissed the suit hold ing that it would be legitimate to infer that the letting was for a manufacturing purpose and hence the notice of termination was bad.
The appellate court reversed that decision.
Aggrieved thereby, the appellant filed a writ petition under Article 227 of the Constitution.
The High Court accepted the finding of the appellate court that the notice of ejectment was valid notice and there was no waiver of notice.
752 Before this Court, it was contended on behalf of the appellant that (1) the exemption from the operation of the Rent Act was given to the Port Trust Authority on the as sumption that it would act in public interest and would not behave like ordinary landlords; (2) the action of the re spondent in terminating the appellant 's contractual tenancy had a public law character attached to it and was according ly subject to judicial review; (3) every action of the respondent which was 'State ' within Article 12 of the Con stitution, whether it be in the field of contract or any other field, was subject to Article 14 of the Constitution and must be reasonable and taken only upon lawful and rele vant grounds of public interest; (4) the respondent 's estab lished rational/policy was to offer/allot a final/reconsti tuted plot for development to the existing occupants thereof as joint tenants; and (5) the eviction of the appellant was not necessary in the public interest for the proper develop ment of the plot as required by the Town Planning Scheme.
On behalf of the respondent it was contended that (1) the onus was entirely on the appellant to establish that the Bombay Port Trust had terminated the tenancy or taken the proceedings in eviction not in public interest but for a collateral purpose or mala fide or that it had acted in a manner contrary to the provisions of Article 14; (2) since there was no obligation or duty cast upon the Bombay Port Trust to provide accommodation, there could be no question of acting in governmental character, and such a body stood on the same footing as any other citizen and would, in respect of such activity, not be subjected to public law duty; (3) the respondent 's dealing with tenants was a con tractual dealing and it was not a matter for public law domain and was not subject to judicial review; and (4) it was the policy of the respondent to allot the entire re constituted plot to one person who was occupying the major portion of such plot, for its proper development.
Dismissing the appeal, it was, HELD: Per Sabyasachi Mukharji, J., (Kania, J. agreeing) (1) Bombay Port Trust being a public body, even in respect of its dealing with its tenants, it must act in public interest, and an infraction of that duty is amenable to examination either in civil suit or in writ jurisdiction.

</s>","  This is an appeal by special leave from the judgment and order dated 19th November, 1986 of the learned Single Judge of the Bombay High Court.
In this appeal this Court has been asked to examine the frontiers of judicial review of the action of a statutory authority, i.e. the Board of Trustees of the Port of Bombay, in evicting its tenant and granting the land in question to another tenant.
However, in order to appreciate the controversy it is necessary to have a conspectus of the facts involved.
The respondent Board of Trustees of the Port of Bombay is a statutory authority.
Vast areas of South Bombay which are completely tenanted, are owned by the respondent.
Being a statutory authority, the respondent has been exempted from the operation of the relevant Rent Act.
The respondent is a statutory corporation constituted under the Major Port Trust Act, 1963 as amended by the Major Port Trust (Amendment) Act, 1974.
Between about 1906 and 1932, one Jhunjhunwala was the lessee of plot No. 6 (which adjoins plot 5B which is the suit plot) and a building was existing on plot No. 6 which was tenanted to M/s Bombay Bharat & Swadeshi Rice Mills, and the said Mills were desirous of operating a rice mill on plot No. 6 but could not get the licence from the Municipal Corporation for the operation of the said rice mill unless satisfactory arrangement was made for the removal and storage of rice husk in a separate chamber/structure.
Since about 1932, the appellant had been the lessee of the respondent in respect of part of the original plot No. 4 (now plot 5B) which adjoins plot No. 6 of the suit plot measuring 113.4 sq. rots.
In or about 1933 34, with a view to acquire the suit plot and using the same for the rice mill/dust room, M/s Bombay Bharat & Swadeshi Rice Mills took over the appellant.
The dust room structure was constructed on the suit plot.
The rice mill on plot No. 6 and the dust room on the suit plot had a common wall and were interconnected by ducts.
It was stated that the respondent's inspectors had regularly visited the premises in question but had never objected to the user of the rice mill/dust room.
In December '57, the Town Planning Scheme No. 1 in Bombay City came into force.
The original plot No. 4 was reconstituted into final plot No. 5 but continued to belong to the respondent.
The Scheme also stipulated that all rights of lessee/tenants in the original plots stood transferred to the final plots.
It may be noted that in December '57 original plot No. 4 comprised of 113.4 sq. let to the appellant, 390 sq.
let to M/s Dhanji Mavji, 453 sq.
let to two associate firms (M/s Gordhandas Ranchoddas and M/s Chunilal Gupta) and 195 sq.
mts.
let to M/s Vassanji Hirji.
Hence, of the final plot No. 5, the appellant and their associates, it was asserted, held 569 sq.
mts., Dhanji Mavji held 390, Vassanji Hirji held 195 sq.
rots.
and the balance 155 sq.
was with the respondent/others.
Total area of final plot 5 was 1309 sq.
mts.
From 1957 72, the respondent, it is asserted, continued the tenancies of the appellant and its associate firms.
In or about 1963, however, the respondent applied for and got final plot No. 5 subdivided into final plot 5A (659 sq.
mts.) and final plot 5B (650 sq.
mts.).
The suit plot and M/s Dhanji Mavji's plot fell entirely in final plot 5B and as a result of the subdivision, Dhanji Mavji became the tenant/occupant of a major portion of the suit plot.
On 1st April, 1974, the respondent issued a notice terminating the tenancy of the appellant and his associates in respect of the suit plot and final plot 5B.
The appellant filed a writ petition challenging the termination of his tenancy.
The writ petition was dismissed by the learned Single Judge of the Bombay High Court on 19th November, 1986.
Against the said order the appellant has filed this appeal by special leave.
758 The main contention raised before us is that the respondent's action in terminating the tenancy of the appellant and his associates in respect of the suit plot and final plot 5B was illegal and void.
It is urged that the respondent's action was motivated by malafides and was actuated by an intention to deprive the appellant and his associates of their rightful possession of the suit plot and final plot 5B.
It is further urged that the respondent's action was in violation of the provisions of the Bombay Rents, Hotel and Lodging House Rates Control Act, 1947 (hereinafter referred to as the 'Rent Act ') and the provisions of the Bombay Town Planning Act, 1956 (hereinafter referred to as the 'Town Planning Act ') and the provisions of the Bombay Municipal Corporation Act, 1888 (hereinafter referred to

"<s>[INST] Summarize:ivil Appeal No. 685 Form the Judgment and order dated the 22nd November, 1963 of the Madras High Court in Appeal Nos 329 and 468 of 1959 F. section Nariman, A. Subba Rao, R. V. Pillai and P. Ramaswami, for the appellants.
M. Natesan, P. section Srisailam and M. section Narasimhan, for L.rs.
Of respondent No. 1 and respondents 2 and 3.
FAZAL ALI, J. This is the plaintiffs ' appeal against the Judgment of the High Court of Madras dated November 22, 1963 by certificate.
The appeal arises out of a partition suit filed by plaintiffs Nos. 1 to 4 for concellation of partition made between the father of the plaintiffs who is defendant No. 5 and defendant No. 1 the elder brother of defendant No. 5.
It appears that as far back as May l, 1940 the two brothers, namely section M. Kuppuswami Chettiar defendant No. 1 and section M. Ranganatham Chettiar defendant No. S, who were originally members of Undivided Hindu Family partitioned their shares by virtue of a registered partition deed dated May 10, 1940.
At the time when the partition was made plaintiffs Nos. 2 to 4 were minors and defendant No. 3 was also a minor.
Under the partition deed both immovable and movable properties were divided between the two brothers voluntarily through the aid and assistance of D.W. 3 K. Narayanswami who was the family auditor of defendant No. 1 and was his friend and adviser.
The partition deed with respect to the immovable properties is Ext.
B l which appears at pp.
243 248 of the Paper Book.
Under the partition deed two Lists were prepared itemising the properties which were to go to the two brothers.
The list of properties is contained in Ext.
B 115 of the Paper Book.
As regards the movable properties it appears that the partition had taken place a month earlier i.e. On April 12, 1940 and 865 the partition deed is Ext.
B 3, which consists of two Schedules Schedule A and Schedule B movables mentioned in Sch.
A were allotted to the defendant No. 1 and those contained in Sch, were allotted to the share of defendant No. 5.
The plaintiffs ' case was that the two brothers who were members or the Undivided Hindu Family along with the plaintiffs and other minor coparaceners betrayed the interests of the minors and the division made between them was both unjust and unfair and had the effect of depriving the minors of their legal shares in the properties the lion 's share having fallen to the lot of elder brother defendant No. 1 section M. Kuppuswami Chettiar hereinafter referred to as 'S.M.K. '.
The plaintiffs? father who is defendant No. 5 being a person of weak intellect did not care to protect the interests of the minors and he accordingly accepted any share that was allotted to him without any objection.
Defendant No. 5 section M. Ranganathan Chettiar would be hereinafter referred to as 'S.M.R. ' Plaintiffs also alleged that the partition was secured by practising fraud and undue influence and by suppressing large assets belonging to the family which were taken by defendant No. I by taking advantage of the weakness of the plaintiffs ' father.
We might mention at the outset that Mr. F. section Nariman the learned counsel for the appellants did not at all press the plea of fraud and undue influence taken by the plaintiffs before the Trial Court and confined his arguments only to the allegation that the partition offered between the two brothers S.M.K. and S.M.R. was on the very face of it unjust and unfair and detrimental to the interests of the minors.
The plaintiffs also laid claim to a sum of Rs. 10,000/ from the cash deposit which is said to have been given to the mother of defendants 1 & 5 but this claim was not pressed before us ill the course of the arguments.
Other minor claims which were also made before the Trial Court were not pressed before us.
The suit was resisted by defendant No. 1 S.M.K. and his major sons defendants 1 and 4 and a minor son defendant 3 who however attained majority during the pendency of the suit before the Trial Court.
We might also mention here that plaintiffs Nos. 2 to 4 sons of S.M.R. were also minors at the time when the suit was filed but plaintiff No. 2 attained majority on October 3, 1958 just about a month and a half before the judgment in the suit was delivered by the Subordinate Jude, Coimbatore.
The defendants stoutly denied the allegations made by the plaintiffs and averred that there was absolutely no disparity in the division of the properties, that no fraud ' or undue influence had been practised, that the properties were divided between defendants I and 5 with the explicit consent of defendant No. 5 and that the division of the properties would show that the partition was neither unjust nor unfair, both parties having taken equal shares in the immovable and movable properties.
A number of other pleas was also raised by the defendants, but it is not necessary for us to deal with them in view of the points pressed before us by the learned counsel for the appellants.
The Trial Court framed as many as 18 issues and after considering the oral and documentary evidence produced before it held that so far as the partition of the immovable properties was concerned which 866 was done by sparate document and was clearly severable from the partition of the movable properties, the partition was neither unjust nor unfair so as to entitle the minors to re open the partition after a long period.
The learned Trial Judge, however, was of the opinion that so far as the partition of movable properties was concerned it was ex facie unjust and unfair and the plea of the plaintiffs for re opening the same must succeed.
The Trial Court accordingly passed a preliminary decree for re partition of the movable properties and directed the appointment of a Commissioner to go into the valuation of the assets sought to be re partitioned.
Both the plaintiffs and the defendants filed separate appeals before the High Court of Madras.
The plaintiffs filed an appeal before the high Court against that part of the decree which dismissed their suit for re opening the partition of the immovable properties., while the defendants filed an appeal against the decree of the Trial Court directing reopening of the partition of movable properties and thus decreeing the plaintiffs ' suit to that extent.
The High Court decided both the appeals by one common Judgment dated November 22, 1963 and by upholding the findings of the learned Subordinate Judge, Coimbator, the High Court made a slight variation in the decree by setting aside the directions of the Subordinate Judge for the appointment of a Commissioner and by quantifying the value of the disparity in the share of the plaintiffs the High Court passed a decree to the extent of 2/5th share of Rs. 17,700/.
The plaintiffs alone have filed the present appeal against the judgment and decree of the High Court after obtaining a certificate from that Court.
Before going into the merits of the case, it may be necessary to mention a few unique aspects of the present case.
It would appear from the findings arrived at by the two courts that defendant No. 1 was undoubtedly an honest man and defendant No. S the younger brother appears to be an idealist a person to whom the value and prestige of the family was a consideration much above mundane monetary matters.
Secondly, the partition between the two brothers was voluntarily made about 35 years ago and the father of the plaintiffs had most willingly and with good grace accepted the partition and the shares that were allotted to him.
Thirdly, since a very long time had elapsed since the partition took place, it would be well nigh impossible for any court to determine the value of the assets, some of which might have disappeared, others may be shrouded in mystery, and for determining the rest the necessary data may not be available.
It appears to us to be too late in the day in 1975 to appoint a Commissioner in order to go into a situation which existed in 1940 and the to pass a decree which may result in a fresh spate of litigation for another decade.
It was possibly this consideration which weighed with the High Court in quantifying the amount of the share of the plaintiffs which they had suffered under the division of the assets.
Finally, the plaintiff 's father defendant No. 5 was a shrewd business and after his elder brother had suffered from some illness, he was carrying on the business of the family a few years in before the partition.
Both the parties were assisted by an Auditor Mr. K. Narayanswami in effecting the partition by metes and bounds.
In these circumstances, therefore, there could be no question of practising 867 any fraud or undue influence as alleged by the plaintiffs and if the partition was unjust or unfair to the minors it was merely because defendant No. 5 made an error of Judgment with respect to some properties.
Lastly, we have not been able to find any material to justify the conclusion of the High Court that the difference in the allotment of the shares to the plaintiffs would be 2/5th of Rs. 17,700/ .We shall deal with this point a little later and show that the difference is much more.
Mr. Nariman learned counsel for the appellants submitted two points before us.
In the first place, he assailed the partition of the immovable properties on the ground that no valuation of the properties was fixed according to the market value and that the plaintiffs were not given any share in the agricultural properties.
As regards the movable properties it was argued that the division was wholly unjust and unfair because the lion 's share was taken by defendant No. 1 and the choice made by defendant No. S the father of the plaintiffs was neither wise nor prudent and was extremely detrimental to the interests of the plaintiffs.
As an instance of the unfairness of the partition Mr. Nariman pointed out that a comparison of Schedules A and of Ext.
B 3 would show that defendant No. 1 was allotted movable properties worth Rs. 1,10,274 2 6, whereas defendant No. 5 was given properties worth Rs. 90,142 4 0 there being a difference of about Rs, 20,000/odd.
He also pointed out that shares of Lakshmi Textile Mills were allotted to defendant No. 1 which were extremely valuable and gave very rich dividends, where as defendant No. S was allotted the shares of Lakshmi Sugar Mills which was one of the sick Mills running at a loss whose dividends were insignificant.
We shall consider this contention raised by counsel for the appellants a little later.
The learned counsel appearing for the respondents Mr. Natesan, however, submitted that the present suit is frivolous and has been filed only with a view to harass the defendants and to re open a partition which was both just and equitable and which was entered by both the brothers with their eyes open and with the aid of their financial expert.
Learned counsel for the respondents, further submitted that there is no reliable evidence to show that there was any cash deposits of Rs. 65,000 as mentioned in Sch.
B, and if there was one it would have been divided on the spot instead of being postponed to a future date.
Similarly it was submitted that so far as the shares are concerned they were chosen by defendant No. S himself and their valuation was equal.
As regards the immovable properties we find ourselves in complete agreement with the arguments of the learned counsel for the respondents that the partition of these properties was fair and just and there is no material on the record to show that the partition worked in any way injustice or was detrimental in any way to the interests of the minors; In this collection we might try to illustrate our point from the findings of the Trial Court regarding the valuation of the immovable properties divided between the two; brothers.
The partition of immovable properties Ext.
B 1 which appears at pp.
243 to 248 of the Paper Book consists of to Schedules A & B. The Trial Court has, after careful consideration of the evidence, very scientifically itemised the properties 868 allotted to each of the brothers and the value of those properties.
For A instance, item 1 of Sch.
allotted to defendant No. 1 is a tank fed nanja land is Kurichi village measuring 3.80 acres and has been valued at Rs. 4,000/ .
Item 2 is a similar land in village Kurichi which is self cultivated and has been valued at Rs. 7000/ .
Thus [he total value of items 1 and 2 of Sch.
A comes to Rs. 11,000/ .
As against this defendant No. 5 was allotted item 2 of Sch.
which on the basis of capitalised value at the rate of Rs. 601/ per month has been fixed at Rs. 14,000/ .
Items 1 & 2 of Sch.
A are the only agricultural properties possessed by the family and the Trial Court has rightly pointed out that whereas defendant No. 1 took the agricultural properties, defendant No. 5 got urban properties not only of the same value but of a higher value.
Similarly item No. 3 of Sch.
A allotted to defendant No. 1 is a house in the Big Bazaar Street and has been valued at Rs. 16,50/ .
As against this the family house in the Oppanakkara Street has been allotted to defendant No. 5 whose value is much more than item No. 3 of Sch.
The capitalised value of the family house in the oppanakkara Street on the basis of rental of Rs. 700/ per month would come to near about Rs. 96,000 .
Item 4 of Sch.
A is a house and site in Ramanathapuram and has been valued at Rs. 7,000/ because it was purchased in 1938 for a sum of Rs. 5,650/ vide Ext.
B 139 dated March 6, 1938.
The learned Subordinate Judge has roughly put the valuation of the said house and site at Rs. 7,000/ in 194().
As against this item 3 allotted to defendant No. 5 is a shop building in the Big Bazaar Street carrying a rental of Rs. 300/ per month at the time of the partition whose capitalised value would be Rs. 7,000/ .
Item No. 5 of Sch.
A which was allotted to defendant No. 1 has been valued at Rs. 2,300/ representing the purchase price of the property mentioned in Exts.
B 140 to B 142.
As against this item 4 of Sch.
which has been allotted to defendant No. 5 was purchased for a sum of Rs. 2,100/ .
It would thus appear that the division of immovable properties is just, fair and equal.
It is true that the properties were not actually valued according to the market rate and that a notional valuation had been given in the partition deed.
But in view of the detailed examination by the two Courts of the fact regarding capitalised value of the properties allotted to the two brothers it cannot be said that the partition of immovable properties was either unfair or unjust or in any way detrimental to the interests of the minors.
After considering the evidence.
, the Trial Court found as follows: ""It is thus found from the available evidence that there was no unfairness or inequality in the partition of the immovable properties effected under Exhibit B 1 and that no ground exists for reopening that partition.
"" The High Court upheld the findings of the Trial Court in these words: ""Thus in regard to the division of the immovable proper ties it is not possible for us to say that there was unfairness or fraud or irregularity in the allotment of the properties between the brothers.
The scheme of the division of the immovable properties seems to us to be fair and we cannot say that the plaintiffs ' father (5th defendant) acted against the interests of his sons 869 or that the 1st defendant took any advantage of his position as the eldest member of the family and allotted to himself the best among the properties available for division.
We there fore confirm the finding of the learned Subordinate Judge that the partition of the immovable properties effected under Exhibit B 1 is binding on the plaintiffs and that the plaintiffs are not entitled to reopen the partition.
"" It is a well settled practice of this Court not to interfere with a con current finding of fact given by the two Courts below in the absence of any extra ordinary or special reasons.
In the instant case we hold that the finding of the l High Court as well as of the Trial Count based on a full and complete consideration of the evidence both oral and documentary and an elaborate and meticulous discussion of all the surrounding circumstances.
We, therefore do not feel inclined to interfere with this concurrent finding of fact which is hereby affirmed.
We might state that the objection regarding the properties not having been properly valued falls to the ground when we find that instead of notional value mentioned in the partition deed which is Rs. 12,517 13 0 for defendant No. l and Rs. 12,000/ for defendant No. S the capitalised value of the items allotted to the two brothers either on the basis of their purchase price or on the basis of the rent fetched by them is almost equal.
The first contention regarding the partition of immovable properties raised by the learned counsel for the appellants being unfair and unjust must therefore be overruled.
We now come to the question of the division of movable proper ties.
In this connection our attention was drawn by Mr. Nariman to Ext.
E 3 which is to be read along with the pencil note of K. Narayana swami D.W. 3, who was the auditor of Defendant No. 1 himself.
Exhibit B 3 is the partition deed of movable properties consisting of shares, deposits, promotes, mortgage deeds and cash, particulars of which are given in Schs.
A & B. Movable properties mentioned in Sch.
A were allotted to defendant No. 1 and those mentioned in Sch.
B, were allotted to defendant No. 5 father of the plaintiffs.
It will appear from a plain examination of the two schedules that whereas defendant No. 1 admittedly got properties worth Rs. 1,10,274 2 6 defendant No. 5 got properties only worth Rs. 90,142 4 0 there being a clear disparity of Rs. 10,000/ because the share of each of the two defendants would be Rs. 1,00,2081 .
On the defendant No. 1 's own documents, therefore? it is clear that a loss of Rs. 10,000/ was caused to defendant No. 5 in the year 1940 and the share of the plaintiffs in this loss would be 2/5th i.e. about Rs. 4,000/ which would swell into a large amount if we add interest for all these 35 years.
That apart the learned counsel for the appellants has submitted that the document Ext.
B 3 deliberately omits to mention a sum of Rs. 65,000/ which was a cash deposit alleged to have been kept in the safe and out of which Rs. 10,000/ were agreed to be given to the mother of the two brothers and the rest, viz. Rs. 55,000/ were to b divided between the two brothers, each defendant getting Rs. 27,500/ .
This is 870 undoubtedly proved by Ext.
A 2 where these figures are clearly mentioned.
Entry No. l of Ext.
A 2 runs thus: Total Settlement section M. K. section M. R. (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) Thanichontham 65,000 55,000 27,500 27,500 Belonging exclusively *Scored out in pencil.
This cash amount of Rs. 65,000/ is denied by defendant No. 1 and it is said that this amount might have been hidden money which never came to the share of the parties.
D.W. 3 K. Narayanaswami has positively admitted in his evidence that he had made this entry in his on hand writing but he scored out this entry as the amount was not available.
Both the Suborclinate Judge, Coimbatore and the High Court have accepted the explanation given by D.W. 3 Narayanaswami although the explanation appears to us to be prima facie false and unconvincing.
Even assuming that this entry was made due to some mistake and had to be scored out, we cannot believe that a person of the expert knowledge and status of D.W. 3 Narayanaswami Iyer the Auditor would forget to make a corresponding correction in the total amount which is given below the statement of account signed by him.
If the amount of Rs. 65,000/ was scored out, then the total would be Rs. 200116/ in Ext.
A 2, but the total shown in pencil in Ext.
A 2 is Rs 2,65,116/ which completely demolishes the case of defendant No 1 and the explanation given by D.W. 3 that the entry was made due to some mistake.
The Courts below have however, relied on a number of circumstances which are purely of a speculative nature, in order to hold that the plaintiffs have not been able to prove the existence of the cash amount of Rs.65,000/ .
One of the circumstances was that according to the evidence of defendant No. 5 the amount of Rs. 65,000/ was taken out from the safe and counted in the presence of defendants 1 and 5 and yet defendant No. 5 did not care to divide it at that time into two equal parts, nor did he insist on the same.
Defendant No. S has, however, given an explanation that as his elder brother wanted that this money should be divided later he did not want to join issue on the subject and trusted his elder brother.
A perusal of the evidence of defendant No. 5 clearly shows that he is an extremely emotional sort of a person who believes in the respect of the family above all consideration.
It is.
, therefore, not unlikely that defendant No. 5 quietly accepted the advice of his elder brother to divide the amount later on.
It was however argued by the learned counsel for the respondents that defendant No. 5 was a shrewd business man having managed the family affairs for quite some time and if such a huge amount was concealed from him by his elder brother he would have undoubtely raised objection at any time before the suit.
This conduct of defendant No. 5 cannot, however, put the plaintiffs out of court.
He had decided to abide by the advice of his elder brother and if he thought that his elder brother did not want to divide the amount of Rs. 65,000/ he kept quiet which is quite in consonance with the 871 character of this man as revealed in his evidence and the circumstances of the case.
Assuming however that defendant No. 5 did not take any objection, as the amount was very huge the silence of defendant No. 5 or even his acquiescence in allowing his elder brother to swallow this amount was not a prudent act and has caused serious detriment to the interests of the minors which he had to protect, because the minors at that time were members of the Hindu Undivided Family.
In view of these circumstances, therefore, we are satisfied that the plaintiffs ' case regarding the deliberate suppression of the cash amount of Rs. 65,000/ has been proved and if this amount would have been available to defendant No. 5, then the plaintiffs would have got 2/5th share of Rs. 55,000/ , (Rs. 10,000/ reserved for the mother) viz. Rs. 27,500/ , as far back as 1940.
The argument of Mr. Nariman on this point is, therefore, well founded and must prevail.
The only other point that was stressed before us by the learned counsel for the appellants was that the Trial Court was right in ordering the appointment of a Commissioner for going into the assets of the movable properties, particularly the question of the shares of the Lakshmi Mills.
We are, however, unable to agree with this argument.
Mr. Natesan learned counsel for the respondents has drawn our attention to some important documents to show that the shares were equaly divided between defendants Nos. 1 and 5 and were actually chosen by defendant No. 5 with his eyes open.
Exhibit B 153 which is a share market report dated April 5, 1940 shows that the paid up value of each share of Lakshmi Sugar Mills was Rs. 50 but the current price of the share at that time was Rs. 41/8/ i.e. it was Rs. 8/8/ below the paid up value and the dividend paid on the share was only Rs. 9/ yearly.
It was, therefore, suggested by counsel for the respondents that defendant No. 5 was given the choice to take the shares of the Lakshmi Mills or the Lakshmi Sugar Mills and in view of the low market rate of the Lakshmi chose to take the shares of the Lakshmi Sugar Mills to the extent of Rs. 10,000/.
In lieu of the shares of other Mills defendant No. 5 took a cash amount of Rs. 13,000/ as would appear from Ext.
It is true that the shares of Lakshmi Textile Mills went up enormously a few years later in view of the international war situation in the continent but defendant No. 5 could not have foreseen such a contingency and if he had made the choice which he thought would be beneficial to the interests of the minors his conduct would have been at best an error of judgment which would not be sufficient to reopen the choice made by him.
Mr Nariman, however, strenuously relied on the evidence of D.W. 3 Narayanaswami Auditor which was to the effect that he expressed great surprise when defendant No. 5 chose the shares of Lakshmi Sugar Mills and in his opinion that was his foolish act.
This is, however, a matter of opinion but the fact remains that the market report of the Lakshmi Mills was not encouraging and therefore there was some justification for defendant No. 5 for not opting for the shares of the Lakshmi Mills.
In these circumstances we hold that so far as the shares of the various Mills were concerned there was no unjust or unequal distribution between the parties.
This item of movable properties, therefore, was correctly divided between the parties.
872 Learned counsel for the respondents submitted that taking a broad view of the whole case the Court should hold that it was not a case of unfair or unjust partition, because both defendant Nos. 1 and 5 were persons who had shrewd business experience and had voluntarily accepted the partition of the properties which was by and large equal.
The learned counsel relied on the decision of this Court in Devarajan and Ors.
vs Janaki Ammal and Ors(1) where this Court observed as follows: ""Generally speaking, a partition once effected is final and cannot be reopened on the ground of mere inequality of shares, though it can be reopened in case of fraud or mistake or subsequent recovery of family property: [see Moro Vishvanath vs Ganesh Vithal Further an allotment bona fide made in the course of a partition by common consent of the coparceners is not open to attack when the shares are not absolutely equal, or are not strictly in accordance with those settled by law.
It is true that minors are permitted in law to reopen a partition on proof that the partition has been unfair and unjust to them.
Even so, so long as there is no fraud, unfair dealing or over reaching by one member as against another, Hindu law requries that a bona fide partition made on the basis of the common consent of coparceners must be respected and is irrevocable:"" It was submitted that the evidence and circumstances of the case clearly show that there was no inequality of shares and the plea of fraud or mistake has not been accepted by the courts and that on the whole the partition was bond fide.
It is true that if this was the position the ratio of the decision in Devarajan 's case (supra) would undoubtedly apply to this case.
But this Court had taken care to point out in these very observations which are underlined by us that this rule did not apply to the minors who are undoubtedly permitted in law to reopen the partition once it is proved that the partition was unfair or unjust to them.
In view of the concurrent finding of fact of the two Courts below that the partition of movable properties, excepting those with respect to the shares, was unfair and unjust, even according to the decision mentioned above the partition with respect to the movable properties has to be reopened.
Moreover in an earlier decision of this Court in Bishundeo Narain and Anr.
vs Seogeni Rai and Jagernath it was observed: ""It is well established that a minor can sue for partition and obtain a decree if his next friend can show that that is for the minor 's benefit.
It is also beyond dispute that an adult coparcener can enforce a partition by suit even when there are minors.
Even without a suit, there can be a partition between members of a joint family when one of the members is a minor.
In the case of such lastly mentioned 873 partitions, where a minor can never be able to consent to the same in law, if a minor on attaining majority is able to show that the division was unfair and unjust, the Court will certainly set it aside.
"" In our opinion the present case falls within the ratio laid down by the decision cited above.
Apart from that there are numerous authorities which have sonsistently held that where a partition is unjust and unfair and detrimental to the interests of the minors the partition would be reopened irrespective of the question of bona fides.
In Lal Bahadur Singh vs Sispal Singh and Ors.(1) it was observed that even though the ground of fraud and mistake failed, the partition which affected the interests of the minor could be reopened.
Similarly in Chanvira 'Pa ' vs Da 'Na ' 'Va ' & Ors.(2) a Division Bench of the Bombay High Court held that a partition will be binding on the minors only if it was just and legal, but if it was made and finalised there being no means of testing the validity of the assets the partition was not final.
The same view was taken in Maruti vs Rama(3) Thus on a consideration of the authorities discussed above and the law on the subject, the following propositions emerge: (1) A partition effected between the members of the Hindu Undivided Family by their own volition and with their consent cannot be reopened, unless it is shown that the same is obtained by fraud, coercion, misrepresentation or undue influence.
In such a case the Court should require a strict proof of facts because an act inter vivos cannot be lightly set aside.
(2) When the partition is effected between the members of the Hindu Undivided Family which consists of minor coparceners it is bindig on the minors also if it is done in good faith and in bona fide manner keeping into account the interests of the minors.
(3) Where, however a partition effected between the members of the Hindu Undivided Family which consists of minors is proved to be unjust and unfair and is detrimental to the interests of the minors the partition can certainly be reopened whatever the length of time when the partition took place.
In such a case it is the duty of the Court to protect and safeguard the interests of the minors and the onus of proof that the partition was just and fair is on the party supporting the partition.
(4) Where there is a partition of immovable and movable properties but the two transactions are distinct and separable or have taken place at different times.
If it is found that only one of these transactions is unjust and 874 unfair it is open to the Court to maintain the transaction which is just and fair and to reopen the partition that is unjust and unfair.
The facts of the present case, in our opinion, fall squarely within propositions Nos.
(3) and (4) indicated above.
In the instant case we find from a perusal of the two schedules 'A ' and 'B ' of Ext.
B 3 that there has been ex facie a disparity of about Rs. 10,000/ to which must be added Rs. 27,500/ which we have discussed above.
Thus the total disparity comes to Rs. 37,500/ and the share of the minor plaintiffs would be 2/5th which comes to Rs. 15,000/ .
This amount of Rs. 15,000/ should have been available to the minor plaintiffs as far back as 1940 when the partition was made and they have been deprived of that amount ever since.
We find that in the peculiar facts and circumstances of the case as already stated it will not be in the interests of the minors nor conducive in the interests of justice to order the appointment of a Commissioner for reopening the entire partition when the shares of the minor plaintiffs are easily ascertainable in terms of money and can be quantified.
In these circumstances we think the best course is to determine the money value of the share of the plaintiffs and to pass a decree for the same which will protect the minors from protracted litigation which might follow the passing of a preliminary decree.
This was the approach made by the High Court but we do not agree with the amount quantified by it.
If we add interest at the rate of 6% per annum as prayed for in the plaint on the amount of Rs. 15,000/ ,the interest calculated at this rate for 35 years from 1940 to 1975 would come to Rs. 31500/ .
Thus the total amount payable to the plaintiffs comes to Rs. 46,500/ .
We, therefore, allow the appeal in part and modify the decree of the High Court to the extent that there will be a decree for a sum of Rs. 46,500/ in favour of the plaintiffs/appellants which represents their share of the movable properties of which they were deprived of.
The plaintiffs would be entitled to future interest at the rate of 6% per annum till payment.
In the circumstances of the case, there will be no order as to costs.
This course, in our opinion, safeguards the interests of the minors to give them their just due and to protect them from a protracted and fruitless litigation.
V.P.S. Appeal partly allowed.
","(1) A partition effected between the members of an Hindu Undivided Family by their own volition and with their consent cannot be reopened unless it is shown that it was obtained by fraud, coercion, misrepresentation or undue influence.
In such a case.
the Court should require strict proof of facts, because, an act inter vivos cannot be lightly set aside.
(2) When the partition is effected between the members of the Hindu Undivided Family which consists of minor coparceners it is binding on the minors also, if it is done in good faith and in a bona fide manner keeping into account the interests of the minors.
(3) But if the partition is proved to be unjust and unfair and is detrimental to the interests of the minors the partition can be reopened after any length of time.
In such a case, it is the duty of the Court to protect and safeguard the interests of the minors and the onus of proof that the partition was just and fair is on the party supporting the partition.
(4) Where there is a partition of immovable and movable properties, but the two transactions are distinct and separable, or have taken place at different times, if it is found that only one of these transactions is unjust and unfair, it is open to the court to maintain the transaction which is just and fair and to reopen the partition that is unjust and unfair.
[873D 874B] In 1940, two brothers, defendants 1 and 5 partitioned their movable and immovable properties by two separate transactions.
At that time defendant S had two sons who were minors.
They and their minor brothers filed a suit in 1952 for cancellation of the partition and for re opening it on the ground that the partition was unjust and unfair and had the effect of depriving the minors of their legal shares in the properties.
The trial court passed a preliminary decree for re partition of the movable properties as it was ex facie unjust and unfair and directed appointment of the Commissioner to go into the valuation of the assets sought to be partitioned while holding that the partition of immovable properties was neither unjust nor unfair.
In appeal, the High Court agreed with the findings of the trial court but set aside the direction of the trial court for the appointment of Commissioner; quantified the value of the disparity in the share of the plaintiffs and passed a decree to the extent of 2/5th share of Rs. 17.700.
In appeal to this court, passing a decree for a sum of Rs. 46,500/ with future interest in modification of the High Court 's decree, ^ HELD: (1) The division of immovable properties was just fair and equal.
The properties were not actually valued according to the market rate and only a notional valuation had been given in the partition deed; but, in view of the detailed examination by the two courts of the facts regarding capitalised value of the properties allotted to the two brothers, it could not be said that the partition of the immovable properties was either unfair or unjust.
This court will not interfere with concurrent findings of the fact given by the courts below in the absence of any extraordinary or special reasons.
[868E F; 869B C] 2(a) But a perusal of the schedules to the partition deed relating to movable properties shows an ex facie disparity of about Rs. 10,000.
[874B] (b) Further, the evidence disclosed that a sum of Rs. 55.000 with defend ant 1, was agreed upon between the brothers to be divided later, but this 7 1127 SCI/75 864 amount was not included in the partition deed.
Assuming that defendant 5 had not taken any objection, since the amount was very large, his Silence or his acquiescence in allowing his elder brother to swallow the amount was not a prudent act and has caused serious detriment to the interests of the minors which he had to protect because.
he and his minor sons were member of an Hindu Undivided Family.
[870H 871B] (c) Taking these two sums into account and calculating the plaintiff 's share in 1940 and adding interest thereon till date of decree, the plaintiffs would be entitled to Rs. 46,500.
[874D E] (d) The High Court was right in holding that it would not be in the interest of the minors or.
Of justice to order the appointment of a Commissioner for re opening the entire partition when the shares of the plaintiffs are easily ascertainable in terms of money and can be quantified.

</s>","  The plaintiffs'case was that the two brothers who were members or the Undivided Hindu Family along with the plaintiffs and other minor coparceners betrayed the interests of the minors and the division made between them was both unjust and unfair and had the effect of depriving the minors of their legal shares in the properties the lion's share having fallen to the lot of elder brother defendant No. 1 section M. Kuppuswami Chettiar hereinafter referred to as 'S.M.K. '.
The plaintiffs'father who is defendant No. 5 being a person of weak intellect did not care to protect the interests of the minors and he accordingly accepted any share that was allotted to him without any objection.
Defendant No. 5 section M. Ranganathan Chettiar would be hereinafter referred to as 'S.M.R.'Plaintiffs also alleged that the partition was secured by practising fraud and undue influence and by suppressing large assets belonging to the family which were taken by defendant No. 1 by taking advantage of the weakness of the plaintiffs'father.
We might mention at the outset that Mr. F. section Nariman the learned counsel for the appellants did not at all press the plea of fraud and undue influence taken by the plaintiffs before the Trial Court and confined his arguments only to the allegation that the partition offered between the two brothers S.M.K. and S.M.R. was on the very face of it unjust and unfair and detrimental to the interests of the minors.
The plaintiffs also laid claim to a sum of Rs. 10,000/ from the cash deposit which is said to have been given to the mother of defendants 1 & 5 but this claim was not pressed before us ill the course of the arguments.
Other minor claims which were also made before the Trial Court were not pressed before us.
The suit was resisted by defendant No. 1 S.M.K. and his major sons defendants 1 and 4 and a minor son defendant 3 who however attained majority during the pendency of the suit before the Trial Court.
The trial court held that the partition was just and fair and that the plaintiffs'father who was a minor at the time of the partition had no right to question the same.

Miss Laila Chacko And Ors. vs State Of Kerala And Ors, AIR 1967 Ker 124

","The legal context of the case Miss Laila Chacko And Ors. vs State Of Kerala And Ors can be understood by examining the relevant Indian laws and constitutional provisions involved.   The main issue in this case was the validity of the eligibility criteria for admission to the MBBS course laid down by Kerala University and the State Government. The petitioners, who were students denied admission, challenged the criteria. The key legal principle applied in this case was that courts should be reluctant to interfere with the reasonable interpretation of eligibility criteria by academic bodies.  The specific question of law in this case was whether the inclusion of mathematics as a subsidiary subject made a candidate ineligible for MBBS admission. The court examined the evidence and found that there was no proof that marks in mathematics were considered for admission. The candidates had passed the missing subjects, which were part of the medical group.   In terms of applicable legal provisions, the court referred to the Kerala University Ordinance prescribing eligibility for MBBS admission and the State Government prospectus laying down the admission criteria. Additionally, the court considered Articles 14, 15(4), and 16(4) of the Constitution of India, which deal with equality and reservation.  The court held that the inclusion of mathematics as a subsidiary subject did not make a candidate ineligible if they had passed the missing subjects in the medical group. The interpretation given by the University Syndicate, which allowed mathematics if the missing subjects were passed, was accepted. The court found no evidence that marks in mathematics were considered for admission, and the merit was determined based on marks in physics, chemistry, and biology/zoology/botany.  The reasoning behind the court's decision was that the eligibility criteria did not expressly prohibit mathematics as a subsidiary subject. The interpretation given by the competent academic body, i.e., the University Syndicate, was entitled to great weight. The court also emphasized the principle of judicial restraint in examining academic decisions taken in good faith.  This case has important implications as it reinforces the autonomy of academic bodies in laying down admission criteria. It upholds the university ordinances prescribing eligibility as binding and cautions against excessive judicial intervention in academic matters. The decision also highlights the high threshold for judicial review of academic decisions and the interpretation of statutes by academic bodies.  Overall, the legal context of the case Miss Laila Chacko And Ors. vs State Of Kerala And Ors can be understood by considering the relevant Indian laws, such as the Kerala University Ordinance, and constitutional provisions, such as Articles 14, 15(4), and 16(4) of the Constitution of India, which were applied in determining the validity of the eligibility criteria for MBBS admission.</s>","The case of Miss Laila Chacko And Ors. vs State Of Kerala And Ors. involves the interpretation and application of various Indian laws and constitutional provisions. The key legal context of this case can be summarized as follows:

1. Article 15(4) of the Constitution of India: This provision allows for reservation of seats for backward classes if they are not adequately represented. The court had to determine whether the reservation for HSC candidates under Article 15(4) was valid.

2. Article 14 of the Constitution of India: This provision prohibits discrimination on grounds of religion, race, caste, sex, or place of birth. The court had to consider whether the reservation for HSC candidates violated the right to equality guaranteed by Article 14.

3. Article 16(4) of the Constitution of India: This provision allows for reservation of jobs for Scheduled Castes (SCs), Scheduled Tribes (STs), and Other Backward Classes (OBCs). The court had to determine whether the reservation for HSC candidates under Article 16(4) was valid.

4. Kerala Education Act, 1963: This act regulates admission to educational institutions in Kerala. The court had to interpret the provisions of the act regarding reservation and eligibility criteria for admission.

In the given case, the court held that the reservation for HSC candidates under Article 15(4) was valid and did not violate the right to equality guaranteed by Article 14. The court also upheld the reservation for SCs/STs under Article 16(4) as valid. However, it struck down the reservation for OBCs as unconstitutional.

Overall, the legal context of this case revolves around the interpretation and application of various Indian laws and constitutional provisions related to reservation policies, equality, and education. The court's decision in this case has significant implications for the implementation of reservation policies in educational institutions in Kerala and beyond. It highlights the importance of balancing the rights of different groups while ensuring equal opportunities for all."

(Under Article 32 of the Constitution of India).
WITH Civil Appeal Nos.
4788 & 4794 of 1992.
C.S. Vaidyanathan, K. Lahiri, P.P.Rao, Vishwajeet Singh, R.B. Misra, 4 R.K. Khanna, Surya Kant, R. Singhvi, C.V.S. Rao, Ms. A. Subhashini, R.P. Singh, S.N. Terdol, A. Sharan, H.K. Puri, Ms. Abha Sharma and K.K. Lahiri for the appearing parties.
The Judgment of the Court was delivered by K. RAMASWAMY, J.
Special leave granted.
As the trio raised common questions of law, they are disposed of by a common judgment.
The 1st petitioner in the Writ Petition is an Association representing the officers of the State Civil Service of U.P. and petitioner Nos. 2 to 17 are its members.
some of them and Bihar State Officers are the appellants in the two appeals respectively.
On January 19, 1984, the association represented to the Govt.
of India requesing to remove wide disparity prevailing in different States of promotional avenues from the State Civil Services to All India Administrative Service.
The officers from Andhra Pradesh and Kerala, on completion of 8 to 9 years of service are becoming qualified for promotion to All India Administrative Service, while the officers from States like Uttar Pradesh and Bihar would get chance only after putting 24 to 27 years of service.
The Estimate Committee of Seventh Lok Sabha too in its 77th Report highlighted the injustice.
A committee of A senior Secretaries constituted by the Union Govt.
recommended, after due consideration, to evolve equitable principles of comparable seniority from different States for promotion to Indian Administrative Service.
Pursuant thereto the Central Govt.
proposed to amend the Indian Administrative Service (Regulation of Seniority) Rules, 1954, for short 'the Seniority Rules '.
In the meantime the Rules were repealed and replaced by I.A.S. (Regulation of Seniority) Rules, 1987 which came with effect from Nov. 6, 1987 for short 'New Seniority Rules '.
The first respondent issued (Circular letter dated September 9, 1986 to the State Govts.
indicating amendments for fixation of seniority of officers promoted from State Civil Services ' to I.A.S. to give weightage over and above 4 years in the assignment of year of allotment as per the existing relevant rules, namely, four years for the first 12 years State service with additional weightage of one year for every two to three years ' completed service subject to a maximum of five years.
After receiving suggestions or comments from State Governments, the Central India exercising the power under sub sec.
(1) of Sec. 3 of All India Service Act, 1951 for short, 'the Act ' amended the New Seniority Rules, 1987 which amendment was published in the Gazette of India on February 3, 1989 for short the 'First Amendment Rules '.
The proviso thereto was made limiting its operation prospectively from February 3, 1989.
Putting the proviso and its prospective operation in issue, the appellants from U.P. in Civil Appeal No. 4788 of 1992[S.L.P. (C) No. 13823 of 1991] filed Original Application No. 18 of 1989 in the Central Administrative Tribunal, Allahabad at Lucknow Circuit Bench, contending that they were promoted in 1980 onwards but by limiting its application to November 6, 1987, they were discriminated.
Bihar Officers questioned the Rule in O.A. No. 136 of 1989 before the C.A.T. at Patna.
Therein the appellants though found to be entitled to the total weightage of 9 years since their juniors were given 1983 as the year of allotment by operation of proviso to Rule 3(3)(ii) of the First Amendment Rules were given 1983 as the year of allotment.
Thereby they were denied 3 years weightage.
The Tribunal at Lucknow held that the prospective operation discriminated the Senior State Civil Service Officers but it refused to direct the Union Govt.
to amend the Rules with retrospective effect.
However, the Govt.
of India was requested to reconsider the matter to give retrospective operation to the First Amendment Rules.
The Tribunal at Patna upheld the rules and dismissed the application.
The Officers from Uttar Pradesh through their Association filed the Writ Petition under article 32 of the Constitution seeking writ of certiorari to quash the order dated December 12, 1990 made by the Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievance and Pension Department and for a mandamus to extend the benefits flowing from the First Amendment Rules to its members promoted prior to January 1988 and to the petitioners Nos. 2 to 17 in particular.
It is needless to state that the First Amendment Rules would operate with full effect from 1992, while the Promotee Officers promoted between 1988 to 1991 would reap partial benefit.
Rule 3 of the Seniority Rules, 1954 postulated assignment of the year allotment as per the Rules to every officer appointed to the Indian Administrative Service, be it a direct recruit or a Promotee officer.
The Promotee officer appointed in accordance with rule 9 of the IAS Recruitment Rules read with regulation 9 of IAS Promotion Regulations shall be allotted an year of allotment next below the junior most direct recruit officer recruited in accordance with rule 7 of the Recruitment Rules (Direct Recruitment Rules) and who officiated continuously in a senior post from a date earlier than the date of the commencement of such officiation by the Promotee officer.
Under the New Seniority Rules 1987, rule 3(1) postulates that every officer shall be assigned year of allotment in accordance with the provisions hereinafter contained in the rules.
The year of allotment of an officer in service at the commencement of the amended Seniority Rules shall be the same as per the rule 3(2) as has been assigned to him by the Central Govt.
in accordance with the orders and instructions in force immediately before the commencement of the New Seniority Rules.
Sub rule (3) of Rule 3 provides thus: ""3(3) The year of allotment of an officer appointed to the Service after the commencement of these rules shall be as follows: 3(3)(i) the year of allotment of a direct recruit officer shall be the year following the year in which the competitive examination was held: Provided that if a direct recruit officer is permitted to join probationary training under rule 5(1) of the IAS (Probation) Rules, 1954, with direct recruit officers of a subsequent year of allotment, then he shall be assigned that subsequent year as the year of allotment.
3(ii) The year of allotment of a promotee officer shall be determined in the following manner]: (a) For the service rendered by him in the State Civil Service upto twelve years, in the rank not below that of a Deputy Collector or equivalent, he shall be given a weightage of four year towards fixation of the year of allotment; (b) He shall also be given a weightage of one year for every completed three years of service beyond the period of twelve years, referred to in sub clause (a), subject to a maximum weightage of five years.
In the calculation, fractions are to be ignored.
(c) The weightage mentioned in sub clause (b) shall be calculated with effect from the year in which the officer is appointed to the service: Provided that he shall not be assigned a year of allotment earlier than the year of allotment assigned to an officer senior, to him in that select list or appointed to the service on the basis of an earlier Select List.
3(3) (iii) The year of allotment of an officer appointed by selection shall be determined in the following manner: a) for the first 12 years of gazetted service, he shall be given a weightage of 4 years towards fixation of the year of allotment; (b) he shall also be given a weightage of one year for every completed 3 years of service beyond the period of 12 years, referred to in sub clause (a), subject to a maximum weightage of 5 years.
In this calculation, fractions are to be ignored; (c) the weightage mentioned in sub clause (b) shall be calculated with effect from the year in which the officer is A appointed to the service: Provided that he shall not become senior to another non State Civil Service Officer already appointed in the service.
Provided further that he shall not be allotted a year earlier than the year of allotment assigned to an officer already appointed to the service in accordance with sub rule (1) of rule 8 of the Recruitment Rules, whose length of class I continuous service in the State Civil Service in the State Civil Service is equal to or more than the length of Class I continuous service of the former in connection with the affairs of the State"".
A plain and fair reading of the sub rules manifests the Central Govt 's intention that the year of allotment of a direct recruit officer shall be the year following the year in which the competitive examination was held.
If any such officer was permitted to join probationary training with direct recruit officers of a subsequent year of allotment then he shall be assigned that subsequent year as the year of allotment.
In determining the seniority of a promotee officer in assigning year of allotment, the service rendered in the State Civil Service upto 12 years as Dy.
Collector, or equivalent posts, weightage of 4 years shall be given.
In addition he/she shall also be given further benefit of one year weightage of every completed 3 years of service, beyond the period of 12 years, subject to a maximum weightage of 5 years.
In its calculations fractions are to be ignored.
the weightage shall be computed from the year of appointment of the officer to the service.
The offending proviso limits the operation of Rule 3(3)(ii)(a) and (b) that such an officer shall not be assigned an year of allotment earlier than the year of allotment assigned to the officers senior to him in that select list or appointed on the basis of an earlier select list.
Under rule 3(3) (iii) also, though not relevant for the purpose of the case but serves as an analogy, that the year of allotment of an officer appointed by selection shall also be given the year of allotment in the same manner as adumbrated in sub rule 3(3) (ii) and its effect also was circumscribed under the proviso that he shall not become senior to another non State Civil Service Officer already appointed to the service.
It is, therefore, clear that the New Seniority Rules were to be operative from November 6, 1987 and the First Amendment Rules from February 3, 1989 with the result that in assigning the year of A allotment, full weightage of 9 years ' eligible service was given to the promotee State Civil Service Officers.
However, the senior officer to him/her appointed from the State Civil Service earlier in the same select list or one above him in the previous select list shall remain senior to him.
Thereby the proviso averted the effect of pushing an officer who gained entry into IAS service by application of rule of weightage in 3(3)(ii) of the rules down in seniority.
It is settled law that ability, merit and suitability are the criteria to select an officer of the State Civil Service for inclusion in the select list for promotion under regulation 9 of the IAS Promotion Regulations, 1955 read with rule 9 of the IAS Recruitment Rules, 1954.
In that behalf no change was brought about.
A junior officer who thus superseded a senior State Civil Officer became entitled to carry his year of allotment and became senior to him in the cadre of l.
But for the proviso, the operation of Rule 3(3)(ii), the senior officer would have been saddled with the disability to be pushed down in seniority which would have nullified and frustrated the hard earned earlier promotion and consequential effect on seniority earned by dint of merit and ability.
Moreover, the entry into the service is from different streams and predominantly by direct recruitment and promotion.
The direct recruit gets his year of allotment from the succeeding year of his recruitment.
The direct recruit officers appointed earlier to 1988 also would be adversely effected in their seniority.
Under sec.
3(2) of the Act, every rule made by the Central Govt.
under sec.3(1) and every regulation made thereunder or in pursuance of any such rules, shall be laid, as soon as may be, after such or regulation is made, before each House of Parliament while in session.
Before the expiry of the session, if both Houses agree to make any modification to such rules or regulations or both Houses agree to make any modification to such rules or regulations or both Houses agree that such rules or regulations should not be made, the rule or regulation shall thereafter have effect, only in such modified form or be of no effect as the case may be.
SO, however, that any such modification or annulment shall be, without prejudice to the validity of anything previously done under that rule or the regulation.
Thereby the rules or regulations made in exercise of the power under sec.
3(1) of the Act regulating recruitment and the conditions of service for persons appointed to an All India Service are statutory in character.
No statute shall be construed so as to have retrospective operation unless its language is such as plainly to require such construction.
The Legislature, as its policy, give effect to the statute or statutory rule from a specified time or from the date of its publication in the State Gazette.
It is equally settled law that court would issue no mandamus to the legislature to make law much less retrospectively.
It is the settled cannons of construction that every word, phrase or sentence in the statute and all the provisions read together shall be given full force and effect and no provision shall be rendered surplusage or nugatory.
I is equally settled law that the mere fact that the result of a statue may be unjust, does not entitle the court to refuse to give effect to it.
However, if two reasonable interpretations are possible, the court would adopt that construction which is just, reasonable or sensible.
Courts cannot substitute the words or phrases or supply casus omissus.
The court could in an appropriate case iron out the creases to remove ambiguity to give full force and effect to the legislative intention.
But the intention must be gathered by putting up fair construction of all the provisions reading together.
This endeavour would be to avoid absurdity or unintended unjust results by applying the doctrine of purposive construction.
In Smt.
Hire Devi & Ors.
vs District Board, Shahjahanpur, , the constitution bench of this court interpreting sections 70 and 90 of the U.P. District Board Act, in particular, the expression. ""orders of any authority whose sanction is necessary"", held that "" No doubt it is the duty of the court to try to harmonise various provisions of an Act passed by the Legislature.
But it is certainly not the duty of the court to stretch the words used by the Legislature to fill in gaps or omissions in the provisions of an Act"".
In Nalinakhaya Bysck vs Shyam Suder haldar 7 Ors.[1953] SCR 533 at 545, this court held that it is not competent to any court to proceed upon the assumption that the Legislature has made a mistake.
The court must proceed on the footing that the Legislature intended what it has said.
Even if there is some defect in the phraseology used by the Legislature the court cannot aid the Legislature 's defective phrasing of an act or add or amend or, by construction make up deficiencies which are left in the Act.
The approach adopted contra by the High Court was held illegal.
In Commissioner of Sales Tax, U.P. vs Auriya Chamber of Commerce, Allahabad; , at 438, this court held that in a developing country like ours any legal system may permit judges to play a creative role and innovate to ensure justice without doing violence to the norm as set by legislation.
But to invoke judicial activism to set at naught legislative judgment is subversive of the constitutional harmony and comity of in strumentalities.
Thus it is settled law that where the intention of statutory amendment is clear and expressive, words cannot be interpolated.
In the first place they are not, in the case, needed.
If they should be added, the statute would more than likely fail to carry out the legislative intent.
The words are the skin of the language which the Legislature intended to convey.
Where the meaning of the legislative intent is what the statute says to be so.
If the language is plain, clear and explicit, it must be given effect and the question of interpretation does not arise.
If found ambiguous or unintended, the court can at best iron out the creases.
Any wrong order or defective legislation cannot be righted merely because it is wrong.
At best the court can quash it, if it violates the fundamental rights or is ultra vires of the power or manifestly illegal vitiated by fundamental laws or gross miscarriage of justice.
It could thus be held that the legislature intended that the First Amendment Rules would operate prospectively from February 3, 1989, the date of their publication in the Gazette of India.
Its policy is explicit and unambiguous.
Rule 3(3) (ii) intended to remedy the imbalances while at the same time the proviso intended to operate prospectively to avert injustice to the officers recruited/promoted earlier than the officer promoted later to that date.
Whether the proviso is violative of article 14 and article 16(1) of the Constitution of India? Undoubtedly all the promotees form the state civil service constitute a class preceding or succeeding or succeeding the First Amendment Rules.
The purpose of temporary truce carved out by the proviso is self evident.
By dint of merit, ability and suitability a junior officer could seal a march over the senior officers in the state civil service and get entry into the Indian Administrative services earlier to the senior officers and thus becomes a member of the Indian Administrative services officer, who was superseded and subsequently became qualified for inclusion in the select list, after the New seniority Rules or the First Amendment Rules came into force, indisputably would be junior in I.A.S. cadre to his erstwhile junior officers in state civil services.
If he gets benefit of the free play of the First Amendment Rules, it would have the inevitable effect of depriving and he would be pushed down and would again become junior to him in senior officer, though had varied length of services, but because of late promotion to Indian Administrative service, would receive and forego proportionate weightage of past service for a short period till the rules fully become operational.
The first Amendment Rules doubtless provided the weightage to a maximum of 9 years and would track back the year of allotment anterior to the date of inclusion in the select list under the Recruitment Rules read with Promotion Regulations.
The proviso intended to protect the seniority of the officer promoted/appointed earlier than the appellants and its effect would be that till rule 3(3) (ii) fully becomes operational graded weightage was given to the promotees.
In other words it prevented to get seniority earlier to the date of his/her appointment to the Indian Administrative service.
Equally it intended not to let endless compulsive circumstances denied the benefits of full 9 years weightage to officers promoted during 1987 to 1992.
The discrimination, though is prevented unequals to become equals.
The contention of sri P.P Rao, therefore, that invidious discrimination was meted out to senior officers and that they are similarly circumstanced are devoid of force.
This Court by a Constitution Bench in the state of Jammu & Kashmir V. T. N. Khosa, ; at 463, held that the amended rules varying the conditions of service would operate in future and governs the future rights of the existing personnel.
The promoted state civil Service Officers who had already the year of allotment in I.A.S cadre are not discriminated.
But the benefit o f full weightage of 9 years was cut down and applied in varied degree to officers promoted during the transitional period to prevent unjust results and to mete out justice to the junior officers or officers promoted earlier and upto 1992.
It is equally settled law that in an affirmative action the court strike down a rule which offends the right to equality enshrined in articles 14 and 16(1) of the Constitution like the one arose in D.S. Nakara vs Union of India, ; and B. Prabhakar Rao vs state of A.P., [1985]2 suppl, SCR 379, this court extended parity in an affirmative action by reading the rule down without doing violence to the language or injustice to others.
The application of the First Amendment Rule has the inevitable and insiduous effect of doing injustice to the direct recruit/promotee officers or officers promoted earlier to Feb. 3 1989 and the proviso avoided such injustice to the date of promotion to I.A.S the rule to all the senior irrespective of the date of promotion to I.A.S. cadre would land in or lead to inequitous or unjust results which itself is unfair, arbitrary and unjust results which itself is unfair, arbitrary and unjust, offending article 14 of the Constitution.
To avoid such unconstitutional consequences the proviso to rule 3(3) (ii) of the First Amendment Rules was made.
The doctrine or kicking down or picking up, put forth in Union of India vs P.K. Roy, at 201 202, equally cannot be extended to the facts of the case.
But for the proviso the operation of rule 3(3) (ii) would be inconsistent with sec.
3(1A) of the Act.
Equally though the doctrine of reading down is a settled principle of law, its application to the facts of the case would lead to injustice to the officers promoted earlier to the appellants.
A writ of mandamus commanding the respondents to give full benefit of weightage of rule 3(3) (ii) and (b) of the First Amendment Rules would amount to direct the executive to disobey the proviso which is now held to be intra vires of the Constitution.
In the light of the above discussion no directions could be given to the central Govt.
to amend to Rules.
Therefore, we have no hesitation to hold that though Govt.
of India has power to amend the New Seniority Rules by First Amendment Rules prospectively giving weightage of total 9 years services to promotee officers of state Civil services in assigning a year of allotment, no direction or mandamus could be issued commanding the Central Govt.
To disobey the proviso or to apply the rules retrospectively to all the officers even to word out monetary benefits as contended by sri Vaidyanathan.
His further contention that the First Amendment Rules would be applied with effect form the date of the New seniority Rules or date of intimation of the proposed First Amendment Rules to the state Government for limited retrospectivity also cannot be acceded to for the same reasons.
In this context it is necessary to note that Sec.
3(1A) of the Act which provides: ""3(1A) The power to make rules conferred by this section shall include the power to give retrospective effect from a date not earlier than the date of commencement of commencement of this Act, to the rules or any of them but no retrospective effect shall be given to any rule so as to prejudicially affect the interests of any person to whom such rule may be applicable.
"" Its bare reading clearly indicates that the Rules made under the Act shall not be given retrospective effect so as to prejudicially affect the ""interest of any person to whom such rules may be applicable"".
The attempt of Sri Vidyanathan that this rule may be so read as applicable only to the promotee officers vis a vis the senior promotee officers cannot be accepted.
The Lucknow Bench of the C.A.T glossed over it by adopting strange construction that since the offending proviso to rule 3(3) (ii) of the First Amendment Rules would apply to promotee officers inter se , sub section (1) (a) of section 3 of the Act would not apply to the direct recruits, to say the least, is disparate construction.
There is a distinction between right and interest.
No one has vested right to promotion or seniority, but an officer has an interest to seniority , But an officer has an interest to seniority acquired by working out the rule.
Of course, it could be taken away only by operation of valid law.
Sub section (1A) of sec.
3 of the Act enjoins the authorities not to give retrospective effect to such a rule or regulation so as to avoid ""Prejudicial affect to the interest"" of any person to whom such rule may be applicable.
The operation of law may have the effect of postponing the future consideration of the claims or legitimate expectation of interest for promotion.
Take a case as an illustration.
Articles 14 16(1), 16(4) ,335 and 46 read with proviso to article 309 of the Constitution empowers the President or the Governor to make satutory rules of reservation, where there is no adequate representation to persons belonging to scheduled castes and scheduled Tribes in a service or posts in connection with the affairs of the Central Govt.
or the state Government.
By operation of rule of reservation appointments or promotions given to a Scheduled Caste or Scheduled Tribe officer, though prejudicially affect the interest of officers of general category on parity of merit, in the larger public interest by the operation of the rule of reservation discrimination in favour of scheduled castes and scheduled Tribes ins constitutionally permissible as class.
Therefore, the proviso to rule 3(3) (ii) of the Amendment Rules is consistent with section 3(1A) of the Act, and that therefore, it is not ultra vires of the power of the central Govt.
nor it offends articles 14 and 16(1) of the constitution.
Counsel for the appellants/petitioners are their contention that there is no vested right to seniority and is variable and defeasible by operation of law.
In A.K. Bhatnagar vs Union of India,[1991] 1 SCR 544 this court held that seniority is an incidence of services and when rules prescribe the method of computation, It is squarely governed by such rules.
This would be amplified by following hypothetical illustrations.
In a direct recruitment the seniority would be arranged in the order of merit and it starts from the date of joining the duty.
Suppose 'A ' to 'D ' were appointed on the same day and 'A ' was senior most among them.
But 'A ' did not pass the prescribed tests and for varied reasons 'A 's probation was confirmed after a long period.
In the meanwhile 'B ' to 'D ' were confirmed 'B ' to 'D ' thereby became senior to 'A ' though appointed in the same day and 'A ' was No. I among them.
Suppose probation was not declared mala fide resulting in delayed confirmation and 'A ' challenged it in a court of law issued by the court to confirm 'A ' challenged it in court of law and succeeded in proving mala fide action and consequential direction was issued by the court to confirm 'A ' from the date of his appointment.
Though 'B ' to 'D ' become seniors to 'A ' later confirmation and the consequential defeasance of acquired seniority.
An empolyee has an interest in the accrued seniority which by operation of law also is liable to be varied.
by 'A ' later confirmation and the consequential defeasance of acquired seniority.
An employee has an interest in the accrued seniority which by operation of law also is liable to be varied.
Suppose 'A ' to 'D ' were appointed on the same day by direct recruitment 'A ' and 'D ' are general candidates and 'B ' and 'C ' though far below in merit and yet were assigned 2nd and 3rd places as per roster and 'D ' lost seniority though secured at the competitive examination due to operation of roster system 'D ' became junior to 'B ' and 'C '.
BY operation of law 'D ' s legitimate interest was thereby defeated.
suppose in promotion posts also similar situation may emerge. 'A ' though senior most in the feeder cadre, due to pendency of charges, he was superseded by 'B ' to 'D ' and thereby they gained early entry into promoted posts and thereby was promoted.
Though 'B ' to 'D ' became initially seniors to 'A ' he was rested to his seniority in 'D ' became initially seniors to 'A ' he was restored to his seniority in promotion posts as well and 'B ' to 'D ' interest was defeated.
Suppose the promotion was on the basis of merit and ability 'D ' was found to be more meritorious and was promoted earlier to `A ' to `C ', `D ' thereby would become senior to `A ' to `C ' though he was junior most in the feeder service.
The right to seniority and interest thereby were varied by operation of law.
Suppose `B ' and `C ' also have the benefit of reservation in promotion as well and by its application they were promoted earlier to `A ' though the latter was more meritorious.
`A ' was later on promoted.
He cannot claim his seniority over `B ' and `C ' who scaled a march over `A ' and became senior to `A ' in promoted cadre or service.
The seniority of `A ' thereby was varied.
However, law itself may protect the legitimate interest in seniority while granting relief to persons similarly circumstanced like the one under sec.
3(1A) of the Act read with proviso to Rule 3(3)(ii) & (iii) of the First Amendment Rules.
It was neither void nor ultra vires offending articles 14 and 16(1) of the Constitution.
Admittedly, the draft of the First Amendment Rules, as circulated to the State Government did not contain the offending proviso.
It is stated in the counter affidavit filed on behalf of the Central Govt.
that some of the State Government had suggested to incorporate the proviso and after necessary consultation the proviso was added to the First Amendment Rule.
Section 3(1) of the Act provide thus: ""3(1) Regulation of recruitment and conditions of services.
(1) The Central Govt.
may, after consultation with the Governments of the State concerned (including the State of Jammu and Kashmir), (and by notification in the Official Gazette) make rules for the regulation of recruitment, and the conditions of service of persons appointed to an All India Service.
"" It is thereby clear that sec.
3(1) empowers the Central Govt.
to make any rule regulating the recruitment and the conditions of service of All India Service, which include amendment from time to time, but the rider it engrafted is that the power should be exercised ""after consultation with the Governments of the State concerned"".
It is already held that by operation of sub section (2) of section 3 of the Act, the rules or regulations are statutory in character.
The meaning of the word `consultation ' was considered in catena of case.
This Court in Union of India vs Sankalchand Himatlal Sheth & Anr.,[1977] 4 SCC 193, held that the word ""consult"" implies a conference of two or more persons or an impact of two or more minds in respect of a topics in order to enable them to evolve a correct or at least a satisfactory solution.
In order that the two minds may be able to confer and produce a mutual impact it is essential that each must have for its consideration full and identical facts which can at one contitute both the source and foundation of the final decision.
In that case the question related to the transfer of a High Court from one High Court to another.
In that context this court considered whether sounding of the Chief Justice of India without meaningful consultation would be proper discharge of the constitutional obligation by the President.
In that context the principle of law laid was that the respective view point of the Govt.
and the Chief Justice must be known to each other and both were to the discuss and examine the merits of the proposed transfer.
The meaning of the word ""consultation"" was evaluated in that backdrop.
This Court approved the dictum laid by K. Subba Rao.
J., as he then was, in R.Pushpam vs State of Madras, AIR 1953 Madras 392.
In State of U.P. vs Manmohan Lal Srivastava, ; at 542, the word ""consultation"" in article 320 of the Constitution of India was considered by a Constitution Bench.
It was held that the word ""consultation"" did not envisage mandatory character for consultation, but the Constitution makers allowed the discretion to the appointing authority to consult the Public Service Commission.
But the executive Govt.
cannot completely ignore the existence of the Public Service Commission or to pick up and choose cases in which it may or may not be consulted.
However, prior consultation was held to be not mandatory for removal of a Govt.
servant as the Central Govt.
has not been tied down by the advice of the U.P.S.C.
This court did not extend the rule of consultation to making the advice of the Commission on those matter binding on the Govt.
In the absence of a binding character, this Court held that non compliance of article 320(3)(c) would not have the effect of nullifying the final order passed by the Govt.
of removal of the Govt.
servant from service.
In U.R. Bhatt vs Union of India, AIR 1962 SC 1344, this Court held that the absence of consultation of the Public Service Commission or any irregularity in consultation under article 320 does not effect the ultimate decision taken by the authority under article 311 of the Constitution.
In Ram Gopal Chaturvedi vs State of Madhya Pradesh, ; , the same view was reiterated.
In N. Raghavendra Rao vs Dy.
Commissioner, South Kanara, Mangalore, ; , words ""prior approval"" of the Central Govt.
in construing the proviso to sec.
115(7) of S.R. Act of the words of varying the conditions of service the Constitution Bench held that ""prior approval"" would include general approval to the variation in the conditions of service with certain limits indicated by the Central Govt.
Same view was reiterated by another Constitution Bench in Mohd. Sujat Ali & Ors.
vs Union of India.
, ; at 469 471.
In Chandramouleshwar Prasad vs Patna High Court & Ors. ; at 674 & 675, construing the word ""consultation"" in article 233 of the Constitution, another Constitution Bench in the context of removal of a District Judge by the Governor on the recommedation of the High Court, held that ""consultation"" or ""deliberation"" is not complete or effective unless the parties thereto, i.e., the State Govt.
and High Court make their respective points of view known to each other and discuss and examine the relative merits of their views.
If the one party makes a proposal to the other who has a counter proposal in his mind which is not communicated to the proposer the direction to give effect to the counter proposal without anything more, cannot be said to have been issued after consultation.
In that case it was held that the absence of any consultation with the High Court rendered the order to removal dated October 17, 1968 passed by the State Govt.
illegal.
In Narain Sankaran Mooss vs State of Kerala & Anr., ; , the facts were that the State Govt.
, exercising the power under Sec. 4 (1) of the Electricity Supply Act, cancelled the licence of the appellant without consulting the Electricity Board.
The question was whether cancellation would be ultra vires of the power.
While examining that question, this court considered whether consultation was mandatory or directory, and held that the revocation of the licence trenches into the right to carry on business guarantee under article 19(1)(g) of the Constitution.
Therefore, when the Act prescribed prior consultation of the Electricity Board such condition was incorporated to prevent abuse to power and to ensure just exercise of the power.
Section 4 of the Electricity Supply Act enjoins, in public interest, to consult the Board before revocation of the licence.
Consultation provided an additional safeguard to the license and when revoking the licence the Govt.
act in two stages.
Before and after the explanation was received and when the Govt.
considered the explanation, it is mandatory that it should consult the Electricity Board and non consultation rendered the order as void.
Consultant of the Board, was therefore, held to be a condition precedent for making order of revocation.
In Naraindas Indurkhya vs State of M.P. & Ors., , M.P. Madhyamik Siksha Adhiniyam Act, 1973 provided that before prescribing the text books the Chairman of the Board was to be consulted.
Its infraction was considered and held that any attempted exercise of the power by the State Govt.
without complying with this condition would be null and void.
On the facts of the case, it was held that the notification issued by the State Govt.
without consultation of Chairman was invalid being in breach of mandatory requirement of the proviso to Sec.4 (1) of the Act.
In Hindustan Zinc Ltd. vs A.P Electricity Board & Ors., ; the revision of tariff was effected without consulting the Consultative Council.
This Court held that the revision of tariff was a question of policy under Sec 78A of the Indian Electricity Supply Act.
The failure of the Board to consult the Consultative Council whether rendered the revision of tariff invalid.
It was held that the consequence of non compliance of Sec.
16 was not provided and the nature of the function of the Consultative Council and force of its advice being at best only persuasive, it cannot be said that the revision of tariff, without seeking the advice of the Consultative Council, rendered the revision of tariff itself invalid.
On the other hand the Board after revision of the tariff has to place the revised tariff on the table of the House or Houses of the Stat Legislature and such statement is open to discussion therein, the Board is bound to take into consideration such modification, if made, or any comments made on such statement by the State Legislature.
Under those circumstance it was held that the non compliance of Sec 16(5) did not render the revision of tariff invalid.
In Rollo & Anr.
vs Minister of Town & Country Planning [1948] 1 All Eng.
Report of the Towns Act, 1946 envisages the Minister of Town & Country Planning after consultation with the local authorities, if satisfied that it is expedient in the national interest that any area of land should be developed as a new town by the Corporation established under the Act, he may make an order designating that area as a site of the proposal of the new town.
On October 7, 1946 press notice was issued giving the date of meeting of the representatives of the local authorities and the Minister explained in the meeting what he had in his mind in arriving at the boundaries of the area.
Objections were raised and public enquiry was held.
But actual explanation was not sought from any local authorities.
In those circumstance contention was raised that there was no consultation as adumbrated under Sec.
Repelling the contention, the House of Lords held that in the meeting the local authorities clearly were informed of the general nature of the proposal, the areas suggested, it size and what the Minister wished and intended to do.
Discussion was followed.
Minutes were prepared and press notice was issued stating what had happened.
In those circumstance it was held that there was consultation and the requirement was complied with.
The ratio of Morris, J. in Elecher & Ors.
vs Minister of Town & Country Planning, [1947] 2 All.
Reports 496, was approved.
The same view was reiterated in Sinfield & Ors.
vs London Transport Executive Law Report 1970 Chancery Divn.
In Derham & Anr.
vs Church Commissioners of England, 1954 Appeal Cases 245, the Judicial Committee was to consider the question of consultation with Church Commissioners of effecting the union of beneficers under Sec.
3(1) of the Pastoral Reorganisation Measure, 1949 which postulates of ""consultation so far as is practicable"".
Construing the language it was held that a meeting was held explaining the proposed scheme, the members of the Church though opposed the scheme, it was approved.
As such it was held that the action was valid and their was proper consultation.
In Port Louis Corporation vs Attorney General of Mauritius, 1965 Appeal Cases 1111, the local Govt.
of Mauritius was empowered under the Local Government Ordinance, 1962 by sec.
73 (1) to alter the boundries of any town, district or village, after consultation with the local authorities concerned.
The Governor and Council of Ministers in May 1963 had in their minds to alter the boundaries of Port Louis, so that the villages surrounding Port Louis Township would be embraced within and would enlarge the area of the town of Port Louis.
The Minister by a letter asked the views of the local authorities, enclosing the details of the proposed alternation and the map.
Majority Councillors had resigned on the ground that they has no mandate to express any views.
On subsequent nomination, those Councillors raised certain points and asked for information, which was duly complied with.
Further information was called for, but the Minister refused to extend time nor supplied information.
The Governor in Council has issued a proclamation extending the boundaries of Port Louis Action was initiated by the local authorities for declaration that the proclamation was ultra vires, null and void in so far as it related to the extended boundries of the town of Port Louis, contending that there had been no consultation as required by Sec.
73 (1) of the Ordinance.
The Judicial Committee construing the word ""after consultation"" in that setting held that the local authorities has received a clear proposal.
The failure to supply information by detailed answers to their questions would not render the proclamation as invalid.
Accordingly uphold the action as affirmed by the Supreme Court of Mauritius.
The ratio in Union of India & Ors.
vs Dr. section Krishna Murthy & Ors., ; , renders little assistance to the appellants.
In that case the question was the year of allotment under the Forest Service (Regulation of Seniority) Rules, 1968.
By fixation of the year of allotment it had retrospective effect from the dated when the promotee was brought into select list or the date of appointment whichever was later.
Under those circumstance it was held that retrospective operation of the rules did not prejudicely affect any vested right much less any fundamental rights of the officers recruited from the State service.
The result of the above discussion leads to the following conclusions: (1) Consultation is a process which requires meeting of minds between the parties involved to evolve a correct or at least satisfactory solution.
There should be meeting of mind between the proposer and the persons to be consulted on the subject of consultation.
There must be definite facts which constitute foundation and source for final decision.
The object of the consultation is to render consultation meaningful to serve the intended purpose.
Prior consultation in that behalf is mandatory.
(2) When the offending action effects fundamental rights or to effectuate built in insulation, as fair procedure, consultation is mandatory and non consultation renders the action ultra vires or invalid or void.
(3) When the opinion or advice binds the proposer, consultation is mandatory and its infraction renders the action or order illegal.
(4) When the opinion or advice or view does not bind the person or authority, any action or decision taken contrary to the advice is not illegal, nor becomes void.
(5) When the object of the consultation is only to apprise of the proposed action and when the opinion or advice is not binding on the authorities or person and is not bound to be accepted, the prior consultation is only directory.
The authority proposing to take action should make known the general scheme or outlines of the actions proposed to be taken, be put to notice of the authority or the persons to be consulted; have the views or objections, taken them into consideration, and thereafter, the authority or person would be entitled or has/have authority to pass appropriate orders or take decision thereon.
In such circumstance it amounts to an action ""after consultation"".
(6) No hard and fast rules could be laid, no useful purpose would be served by formulating words or definitions nor would it be appropriate to lay down the manner in which consultation must take place.
It is for the Court to determine in each case in the light of its facts and circumstances whether the action is ""after consultation""; ""was in fact consulted"" or was it a ""sufficient consultation"".
(7) Where any action is legislative in character, the consultation envisages like one under Sec.
3(1) of the Act, that the Central Govt.
is to intimate to the State Governments concerned of the proposed action in general outline and on receiving the objections or suggestions, the Central Govt.
or Legislature is free to evolve its policy decision, make appropriate legislation with necessary additions or modification or omit the proposed one in draft bill or rules.
The revised draft bill or rules, amendments or additions in the altered or modified form need not again be communicated to all the concerned State Governments nor have prior fresh consultation Rules or Regulations being legislative in character, would tacitly receive the approval of the State Government through the people 's representative when laid on the floor of each House of Parliament.
The Act or the Rule made at the final shape is not rendered void or ultra vires or invalid for non consultation.
The proposal for amending the new Seniority Rules in the draft was only for inviting discussion and suggestions on the scope and ambit of the proposed law and the effect of the operation of the First Amendment Rules.
Keeping the operational effect in view the proposed amendment could be modified or deleted or altered.
The Central Govt.
is not bound to accept all or every proposal or counter proposal.
Consultation with the Ministry of Law would be sufficient.
Thereby the Central Govt.
is not precluded to revise the draft rules in the light of the consultation and advice.
The Central Govt.
had prior consultation with the State Governments concerned and the Law Department.
In the light of the above principle and applying them to the facts of this case we have no hesitation to hold that the general consultation has by the Central Govt.
with the State Govts.
and Union Territories was sufficient and it was not necessary to have prior consultation again to bring the proviso on statutes as part of the First Amendment Rules.
The contention of Sri Vaidyanathan that the proviso is rendered void for the absence of consultation of the State Govts.
is devoid of any force.
By operation of sub sec.
(2) of Sec. 3 the rules laid on the floor of each House of the Parliament.
There were no suggestions or alterations made by either House of Parliament.
Under the circumstance we have no hesitation to hold that the failure to consult all the State Governments or Union Territories on the proviso to rule 3(3)(ii) or (iii) of the First Amendment Rules does not render the proviso ultra vires, invalid or void.
Accordingly, we do not find any merit to issue the writ as prayed for in the writ petition.
The Writ Petition and Civil Appeal arising out of S.L.P. (C) No. 12469/90 are dismissed.
The appeal arising out of S.L.P. (C) No. 13823/91 is allowed and the order of the Central Administrative Tribunal, Allahabad Bench at Lucknow is set side.
But in the circumstance parties are directed to bear their own costs throughout.
WP (C) No. 499/91 dismissed.
C.A. No. 4794/92 dismissed.
C.A. No. 4788/92 allowed.
","On 19.1.1984, the Association [petitioner No. 1 in W.P. (C) No. 499 of 1991] requested the Union Government (Respondent) to remove the disparity prevailing in different states of promotional avenues from State Civil Services to All India Administrative Service.
A Committee of Senior Secretaries, constituted by the Union Government, recommended an equitable principle of comparable seniority from different States for promotion to the Indian Administrative Service.
The I.A.S. (Regulation of Seniority) Rules, 1987 came into force with effect from 6.11.1987, repealing the old Rules.
In a Circular dated 9.9.1986 issued by the respondent Union Government directed the State Governments to give weightage over and above four years the assignment of year of allotment as per the existing rules, namely, four years for the first 12 years State service with additional weightage one year for every two to the years completed service subject to a maximum of five years.
Union Government amended and published the New Seniority Rules, 1987, after considering the suggestions from the State Governments.
The First Amendment Rules was published in the Gazette of India on 32.1989 which was given prospective operation from 3.2.1989.
The appellants in C.I. No. 4794 of 1992 questioned Rule 3(3) (ii) proviso of the First Amendment Rules, in an application before the CAT.
at Patna.
They contended that though they were found to be entitled to the total weightage of 9 years since the juniors were given 1983 as the year of allotment by operation of proviso to Rule 3(3)(ii) of the First Amendment Rules, were given 1983 as the year of allotment and thereby the appellants were denied the 3 years weightage.
The Tribunal upheld the Rules and dismissed the application, against which appeal C.A. No. 4794 of 1992 was filed in this Court.
The appellants in C.A. No. 4788 of 1992, some members of the Association petitioner No. 1 of the W.P. (C) No. 499 of 1991 filed an application before the Central Administrative Tribunal at Lucknow contending that they were promoted in 1980 onwards, and they were discriminated in fixation of their seniority.
The Tribunal held that the prospective operation of the 1987 Rules discriminated the Senior State Civil Service Officers, but refused to direct the Union Government to amend the Rules but retrospective effect.
However, it requested the Government of India to reconsider the matter and to give retrospective operation to the First Amendment Rules.
This decision was questioned hl an appeal C.A. No. 4788 of 1992.
In WP(C)No. of 499 of 1991, Petitioner No. 1 An Association representing the officers of the U.P. State Civil Service and petitioners 2 17, its members filed the writ petition under Article 32 of the Constitution to quash the order of the respondent Union Government dated 12.12.1990, and for a direction to extend the benefit flowing from the First Amendment Rules to its members promoted prior to January 1988.
It was contended that the First Amendment Rules operated with effect from 1992, whereas the promotee Officers were promoted between 1988 to 1991 and that they would get only partial benefit.
As these cases raised common questions of law, they were heard together.
Dismissing WP(C)No.
499/1991 and CA No. 4794 of 1992, and allowing C.A No. 4788 of 1992, this Court, HELD: 1.01.
The entry into the service is from different streams and predominantly by direct recruitment and promotion.
The direct recruit gets his year of allotment from the succeeding year of his recruitment.
The direct recruit officers appointed earlier to 1988 also would be adversely affected in their seniority.
[403 D] 1.02.
Rule 3(31 manifests the Central Govt 's intention that the year of allotment of a direct recruit officer shall be the year following the year in which the competitive examination was held.
If any such officer was permitted to join probationary training with direct recruit officers of a subsequent year of allotment then he shall be assigned that subsequent year as the year of allotment.
[400 G H] 1.03.
In determining the seniority of a promotee officer in assigning year of allotment, the service rendered in the State Civil Service upto 12 years as Dy.
Collector, or equivalent posts, weightage of 4 years shall be given.
In addition he/she shall also be given, further benefit of one year weightage of every completed 3 years of service.
beyond the period of 12 years, subject to a maximum weightage of 5 years.
In its calculations fractions are to be ignored.
The weightage shall be computed from the year G of appointment of the officer to the service.
[402 E] 1.04.
The offending proviso limits the operation of Rule 3(3) (ii) (a) and (b) that such an officer shall not be assigned an year of allotment earlier than the year of allotment assigned to the officer senior to him in that select list or appointed on the basis of an earlier select list.
[1402 F] 105.
The proviso aims that the State Civil Service senior officer ' though had varied length of services, but because of late promotion to Indian Administrative Service, would receive and forego proportionate weightage of past service for a short period till the rules fully become operational.
[406 B] 1.06.
The first amendment rules doubtless provided the remedy to remove existing discriminatory results by giving graded weightage to a maximum of 9 years and would track back the year of allotment anterior to the date of inclusion in the select list under the Recruitment Rules read with Promotion Regulations.
[406 C] 1.07.
The Proviso intended to protect the seniority of the officers promoted/appointed earlier than the appellants and its effect would be that till rule 3 (3) (ii) fully becomes operational graded weightage was given to the promotees.
In other words it prevented to get seniority earlier to the date of his/her appointment to the Indian Administrative Service.
Equally it in tended not to let endless chain reaction occur to unsettle the settled interests in seniority.
These compulsive circumstances denied the benefits of full 9 years weightage to officers promoted during 1987 to 1992.
The discrimination, though is discernible, but inevitable to ensure just results.
In other words the proviso prevented unequals to become equals.
[406 D E] 1.08.
The new Seniority Rules were to be operative from November 6, 1987 and the First Amendment Rules from February 3, 1989 with the result that in assigning the year of allotment, full weightage of 9 years ' eligible service was given to the promotee State Civil Service Officers.
However, the senior officer to him/her appointed from the State Civil Service earlier in the same select list or one above him in the previous select list shall remain senior to him.
Thereby the proviso averted the effect of pushing an officer who gained entry into IAS service by application of rule of weightage in Rule 3(3) (ii) of the Rules down in seniority.
[402 H, 403 A B] 1.09.
By dint of merit, ability and suitability junior officer could steal a march over the senior officers in the State Civil Service and get entry into the Indian Administrative Service earlier to the senior officers and thus becomes a member of the Indian Administrative Service.
Thereby he becomes senior in service.
The senior State Civil Service officer, who was superseded and subsequently became qualified tor inclusion in the select list, after the new Seniority Rules or the First Amendment Rules came into force, indisputably would be junior in I.A.S. cadre to his erstwhile junior officers in State Civil Service.
If he gets the benefit of the free play of the First Amendment Rules, it would have the inevitable effect of depriving the promoted erstwhile junior officer of the benefit of early promotion and he would be pushed down and would again become junior to him in the Indian Administrative Service.
[405 G H; 406 A B] 1.10.
A junior officer who superseded a senior State Civil Officer became entitled to carry his year of allotment and became senior to him in the cadre of I.A.S. But for the proviso, the operation of Rule 3(3)(ii), the senior officer would have been saddled with the disability to be pushed down in seniority which would have nullified and frustrated the hard earned earlier promotion and consequential effect on seniority earned by dint of merit and ability.
[403 E] 2.01.
No statute shall be construed so as to have retrospective operation unless its language is such as plainly to require such a construction.
The legislature, as its policy, give effect to the statute or statutory rule from a specified time or from the date of its publication in the State Gazette.
1404 A] 2.02.
Court would issue no mandamus to the legislature to make law much less retrospectively.
It is the settled cannons of construction that every word, E phrase or sentence in the statute and all the provisions read together shall be given full force and effect and no provision shall be rendered surplusage or nugatory.
[404 B] 2.04.
The mere fact that the result of a statute may be unjust, does not entitle the court to refuse to give effect to it.
However, if two reasonable interpretations are possible, the Court would adopt that construction which is just, reasonable or sensible.
Courts cannot substitute the words or phrases or supply casus omissus.
The court could in an appropriate case iron out the creases to remove ambiguity to give full force and effect to the legislative intention.
But the intention must be gathered by putting up fair construction of all the provisions reading together.
This endeavour would be to avoid absurdity or unintended unjust results by applying the doctrine or purposive construction.
1404 C D] 2.05.
Where the intention of statutory amendment is clear and expressive, words cannot be interpolated.
In the first place they are not, in the ease, needed.
If they should be added, the statute would more than likely fail to carry out the legislative intent.
The words are the skin of the language which the legislature intended to convey.
[405 B] 2.06.
Where the meaning of the statute is clear and sensible, either with or without omitting the words or adding one, interpolation is improper, since the primary purpose of the legislative intent is what the statute says to be so.
If the language is plain, clear and explicit, it must be given effect and the question of interpretation does not arise.
[405 C] 2.07.
If found ambiguous or unintended, the court can at best iron out the creases.
Any wrong order or defective legislation cannot be righted merely because it is wrong.
At best the court can quash it, if it violates the fundamental rights or is ultra vires of the power or manifestly illegal vitiated by fundamental laws or gross miscarriage of justice.
[405 D] 2.08.
The Legislature intended that the First Amendment Rules would operate prospectively from February 3, 1989, the date of their publication in the Gazette of India.
Its policy is explicit and unambiguous, Rule 3(3)(ii) intended to remedy the imbalances while at the same time the proviso intended to operate prospectively to avert injustice to the officers recruited/promoted earlier than the officer promoted later to that date.
The proviso carved out an exception to ward off injustice to the officers that became members of I.A.S. earlier to those dates.

The application of the First Amendment Rules has the inevitable and insiduous effect of doing injustice to the direct recruit promotee officer or officers promoted earlier to Feb. 3, 1989 and the proviso avoided such unjust results.
Giving retrospective effect or directing to apply the rule to all the seniors irrespective of the date of promotion to I.A.S. cadre would land in or lead to inequitous or unjust results which itself is unfair, arbitrary and unjust.
offending article 14 of the Constitution.
To avoid such unconstitutional consequences the proviso to Rule 3(3)(ii) of the First Amendment Rules was made.
[407 C] 3.02.
But for the proviso the operation of Rule 3(3)(ii) would be inconsistent with Sec. 3(1A) of the Act.
Equally though the doctrine 'Reading down ' is a settled principle of law, its application to the facts of the case would lead to injustice to the officers promoted earlier to the appellants.
A writ of mandamus commanding the respondents to give full benefit of weightage of Rule 3(3)(ii)(a)&(b) of the First Amendment Rules would amount to direct the executive to disobey the proviso which is now held to be intra vires of the Constitutions.
[407 D] 3.03.
The proviso to Rule 3(3)(ii) of the First Amendment Rules is consistent with section 3(1A) of the Act and it is not ultra vires of the power the Central Govt.
nor it offends articles 14 and 16(1) of the Constitution.
[409 A] 3.04.
There is a distinction between right and interest.
No one has a vested right to promotion or seniority, but an officer has an interest to seniority acquired by working out the rule.
Of course, it could be taken away only by operation of valid law.
[408 E] 3.05.
Law itself may protect the legitimate interest in seniority while granting relief to persons similarly circumstanced like the one under sec.
3(1A) of the Act read with proviso to Rule 3(3) (ii) & (iii) of the First Amendment Rules.
It was neither void nor ultra vires offending articles 14 and 16(1) of the Constitution.

Consultation is a process which requires meeting of minds between the parties involved in the process of consultation on the material facts and points involved to evolve a correct or at least satisfactory solution.
There should be meeting of minds between the proposer and the persons to be consulted on the subject of consultation.

The object of the consultation is to render consultation meaningful to serve the intended purpose.
Prior consultation in that behalf is mandatory.
[415 E] 4.03.
When the offending action effects fundamental rights or to effectuate built in insulation, as fair procedure, consultation is mandatory and non consultation renders the action ultra vires or invalid or 4.04.
When the opinion or advice binds the proposer, consultation is mandatory and its infraction renders the action or order illegal.
1415 F] 4.05.
When the opinion or advice or view does not bind the person or authority, any action or decision taken contrary to the advice is not illegal, nor becomes void.
[415 G] 4.06.
When the object of the consultation is only to apprise of the proposed action and when the opinion or advice is not binding on the authorities or person and is not bound to be accepted, the prior consultation is only directory.
The authority proposing to take action should make known the general scheme or outlines of the actions proposed to be taken, be put to notice of the authority or the persons to be consulted, have the views or objections, taken them into consideration, and there after, the authority or person would be entitled or has/have authority to pass appropriate orders or take decision thereon.
In such circumstances it amounts to an action ""after consultation"".
[415 H, 416 A B] 4.07.
No hard and fast rule could be laid, no useful purpose would be served by formulating words or definitions nor would it be appropriate or lay down the manner in which consultation must take place.
It is for the Court to determine in each case in the light of its facts and cir cumstances whether the action is ""after consultation"", ""was in fact consulted"" or was it a ""sufficient consultation"".
[416 C] 4.08.
Where any action is legislative in character, the consultation envisages like one under Sec.
3 (1) of the Act, that the Central Govt.
is to intimate to the State Governments concerned of the proposed action in general outlines and on receiving the objections or suggestions, the Central Govt.
or Legislature is free to evolve its policy decision, make appropriate legislation with necessary additions or modification or omit the proposed one in draft bill or rules.
The revised draft bill or rules, amendments or additions in the altered or modified from need not again be communicated to all the concerned State Governments nor have prior fresh consultation.
Rules or Regulations being legislative in character, would tacitly receive the approval of the State Governments through the people 's representatives when laid on the floor of each House of Parliament.
The Act or the Rule made at the final shape is not rendered void or ultra vires or invalid for non consultation.
[416 D F] 4.09 The proposal for amending the new Seniority Rules in the draft was only for inviting discussion and suggestions on the scope and ambit of the proposed law and the effect of the operation of the First Amendment Rules.
Keeping the operational effect in view the proposed amendment could be modified or deleted or altered.
[416 G] 4.10 The Central Govt.
is not bound to accept all or every proposal or counter proposal.
Consultation with the Ministry of Law would be sufficient.
Thereby the Central Govt.
is not precluded to revise the draft rules in the light of the consultation and advice.
[416 H] 4.11 The general consultation had by the Central Govt.
with the State Govts.
and Union Territories was sufficient and it was not necessary to have prior consultation again to bring the proviso on statutes as part of the First Amendment Rules.
[417 B] 4.12 By operation of sub sec.
(2) of Sec. 3 the rules were laid on the floor of each House of the Parliament.
There were no suggestions or alterations made by either House of Parliaments.
Thus the First Amendment Rules stood approved by the Parliament.
[417 C] 4.13 The failure to consult all the State Governments or Union Territories on the proviso to Rule 3(3) (ii) or (iii) of the First Amendment Rules does not render the proviso ultra vires, invalid or void.

</s>","  The appellants in Civil Appeal No. 4788 of 1992 and the respondents in Civil Appeal No. 4794 of 1992 were promoted to the Indian Administrative Service (IAS) from the State Civil Service of Uttar Pradesh and Bihar respectively.
They claimed that they were entitled to a total weightage of 9 years in the year of allotment for the purpose of seniority in the IAS.
The appellants alleged that the Union Government had amended the Indian Administrative Service (Regulation of Seniority) Rules, 1987 (hereinafter referred to as the 'Old Rules ') by introducing a proviso to Rule 3(3)(ii) of the First Amendment Rules, 1989 (hereinafter referred to as the 'Amendment Rules ') which limited the operation of the Amendment Rules to those officers who were promoted to the IAS on or after February 3, 1989.
The appellants claimed that this amendment resulted in discrimination against them as they were promoted to the IAS before February 3, 1989.
The respondents, on the other hand, argued that the Amendment Rules were applicable to all officers who were promoted to the IAS on or after February 3, 1989, and that there was no provision in the Old Rules to provide for any retrospective operation.
The appellants also challenged the validity of the Amendment Rules on the ground that they violated Article 14 of the Constitution of India.
The appellants further contended that the Amendment Rules were not in accordance with the recommendations of the Estimates Committee of the Seventh Lok Sabha and the Union Public Service Commission.
The appellants prayed for a declaration that the Amendment Rules were invalid and unconstitutional.
They also sought a direction to the Union Government to amend the Old Rules with retrospective effect so as to provide for the same weightage as provided in the Amendment Rules to all officers who were promoted to the IAS before February 3, 1989.
The appellants also sought a direction to the Union Government to pay the difference between the salary paid to them and the salary they would have received if the Amendment Rules had been applied to them from the date of their promotion.
The appellants also prayed for a direction to the Union Government to treat them as having been promoted to the IAS on February 3, 1989.
The appellants also sought a direction to the Union Government to make good the loss suffered by them due to the non application of the Amendment Rules to them from the date of their promotion.
The appellants also prayed for a direction to the Union Government to take appropriate steps to rectify the records of the Union Public Service Commission and the Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions showing the date of promotion of the appellants to the IAS as February 3, 1989.

U.R. Lalit, R.S. Yadav and H.M. Singh for the Respondents.
The Judgment of the Court was delivered by PG NO 573 JAGANNATH SHETTY, J.
These two appeals, by special leave, are directed against a judgment of the High Court of Punjab & Haryana in Criminal Appeal No. 128 SP of 1984.
The common respondents in the appeals.
were prosecuted for various offenses in the court of Additional Sessions judge, Faridkot.
By judgment dated February 28,1984 learned Judge convicted and sentenced the accused as follows: ""Keeping in view the circumstances of the case and the part played by each of them I, hereby sentence Sukhbir, Sukhpal and Surat Singh accused to undergo R.I. for four years u/s 307/149 IPC.
Each of Om Pal, Dhan Pal, Mannu and Siri Chand are ordered to undergo R.I. for three year.
u/s 307/149 IPC.
Each of the seven accused are further ordered to undergo R.I. for one year 148 IPC, two years R.I. u/s 325 149 IPC and one year R. I. s/u 323/149 IPC.
Keeping in view the circumstances of the case.
all the sentences shall run concurrently. ' ' The accused appealed t the High Court challenging the conviction and sentence.
The High Court by the judgment under appeals acquitted Sukhpal Singh and Surat singh of all charges by giving them the benefit of doubt.
The other accused who are respondents herein are also acquitted of the offence under section 307/149 and section 148 IPC.
There conviction and sentence under section 325/149, 323/149 and section 148 IPC are however.
maintained.
They are released on probation of good conduct.
Each one of them, is ordered to pay compensation of Rs. 2,500 to Joginder who was seriously injured in the incident.
In default to pay the compensation they are directed to serve their sentence.
The operative portion of the judgment runs like this: ""There is no previous history of enmity between to parties.
The occurrence is the outcome of a sudden flare up.
I think, these five appellants namely Sukhbir Singh Dhanpal, Mannu, Siri Chand and Om Pal are entitled their benefit under section 360 Cr.
Consequently, I suspend their sentence under section 325/149, 323/149 and section 148 IPC and order that the appellants namely Sukhbir Singh, Dhan Pal Mannu.
Siri Chand and Om Pal be released on probation on their entering into bonds of Rs.3,000 each with one surety in the like amount for a period of one year, to the satisfaction of the trial PG NO 574 court, undertaking to appear in the court to receive the sentence during the said period whenever called upon to do so and in the meantime to keep peace and be of good behavior.
However, each one of the appellant would pay Rs.2,500 as compensation payable to Joginder injured.
Compensation if not paid within two months, the appellants namely Sukhbir Singh, Dhanpal.
Mannu, Siri Chand and Om Pal would be called upon to serve their sentence.
But for this modification, appeal fails and is hereby dismissed.
In view of section 12 of the , no disqualification would attach to the appellants due to this conviction.
Sd/ K.P.S.Sandhu Judge"" Dt.
November 13, l984 In these appeals, there is no serious dispute with regard to acquittal of Sukhpal Singh and Surat Singh.
The prosecution case that they were armed with Barchha has not been proved.
There was no incised injury on the victim or any of the prosecution witnesses.
Their participation in the commission of crime therefore appears to be doubtful.
The High Court was justified in acquitting them.
Counsel for the appellants are, however, vary critical of the order of High Court with regard to the remaining accused.
It is urged that the High Court was too much charitable to, them.
The intention of accused was obviously to commit murder of joginder.
Their acquittal under section 307 IPC is characterised as perverse.
At any rate, it is said that they ought not have been put on probation.
It is an abuse of the process of Court.
They should have been properly sentenced by term of imprisonment and fine.
It is also urged that Joginder has sustained permanent disability due to head injury and no amount of compensation would be adequate for him except severe punishment to the accused as a general deterrence.
Counsel for the accused on the other hand, seeks to support the order of the High Court in every respect.
In the light of the submissions, three questions arise consideration (i) whether the respondents are not guilty of the offence under section 307/149 IPC; (ii) whether the High Court was justified in extending the benefit of section 360 Cr.
P.C. and releasing the accused on probation of good conduct; and (iii) whether the compensation awarded to PG NO 575 Joginder could be legally sustained, and if so, what should be the proper compensation ? For a proper consideration of these questions, we may summarise briefly the factual background: The rival parties in this case are collaterals.
On September 28, 1982 at about 8/9 a.m. they had an altercation near the tubewell belonging to Hari Kishan.
Joginder is the son of Hari Kishan.
Virender another injured in this case is nephew of Hari Kishan.
Hari Kishan was sitting near his tubewell.
Virender and Joginder were sowing Berseem crop.
The accused carne from the side of the tubewell.
They were armed with Ballams and Dangas.
One of them raised a Lalkara at which the accused attacked Virender and Joginder.
In the brawl that followed some of the accused were also injured.
The injured were removed to Civil Hospital, Ballabgarh.
The Medical Officer there referred them to Safdarjung Hospital, New Delhi.
Finally., they landed themselves at the AIIMS, New Delhi.
They were examined by the Doctors.
Virender was found to have two injuries caused by blunt weapons.
Joginder was found to have head injury.
Amongst the accused Siri Chand, Dhan Pal, Om Pal and Sukhbir Singh were injured.
They were medically examined in AIIMS or Safdarjung Hospital, New Delhi.
Siri Chand had four injuries including a fracture caused by blunt weapon.
that has been proved by Dr. Rita Sood (DW1).
Dhan Pal and Om Pal each had four injuries but simple.
They were also, caused by blunt weapons.
Dr. V.K. Dhingra (DW 2) has spoken to that.
Sukhbir singh had one incised wound on his person.
Anurag Saxena (DW 3) has testified.
On the first question as to acquittal of the accused under s.3O7/149 IPC, some significant aspects may be borne in mind.
Under s.307 IPC what the Court has to see is, whether the act irrespective of its result, was done with the intention or knowledge and under circumstances mentioned in that section.
The intention or knowledge or the accused must be such as is necessary constitute ' murder.
Without this ingredient being established, there can be no offence of ""attempt to murder"".
Under section 307 the intention precedes the act attributed to accused.
Therefore, the intention is to be gathered from all circumstances, and not merely from the consequences that ensue.
The nature of the weapon used, manner in which it is used.
motive for the crime,severity of the blow, the part of the body where the injury is inflicted are some of the factors that may be taken into consideration it,determine the intention.
In this case, two parties in the course of a fight inflicted on each other injuries both serious and minor.
The accused though armed with ballam never used the sharp edge of it.
PG NO 576 They used only the blunt side of it despite they being attacked by the other side.
They suffered injuries but not provoked or tempted to use the cutting edge of the weapon.
It is very very significant.
It seems to us that they had no intention to commit murder.
They had no motive either.
The fight as the High Court has observed, might have been a sudden flare up.
Where the fight is accidental owing to a sudden quarrel, the conviction under section 307 is generally not called for.
We, therefore, see no reason to disturb the acquittal of accused under section 307 IPC.
The question next to be considered is whether the accused are entitled to the benefit of probation of good conduct ? We gave our anxious consideration to the contentions urged by counsel.
We are of opinion that the High Court has not committed any error in this regard also.
Many offenders are not dangerous criminals but are weak characters or who have surrendered to temptation or provocation.
In placing such type of offenders, on probation, the Court encourages their own sense of responsibility for their future and protect them from the stigma and possible contamination of prison.
In this case.
the High Court has observed that there was no previous history of enmity between the parties and the occurrence was an outcome of a sudden flare up.
These are not shown to be incorrect.
We have already said that the accused had no intention to commit murder of any person.
Therefore,the extension of benefit of the beneficial legislation applicable to first offenders cannot be said to be inappropriate.
This takes us to, the third questions which we have formulated earlier in this judgments.
The High Court has directed each of the respondents to pay Rs. 2,500 as compensation to Joginder.
The High Court has not referred to any provision of law in support of the order of compensation.
But that can be traced to section 357 Cr.
P.C. Section 357, leaving aside the unnecessary, provides : ""357.
Order to pay compensation : (1) When a court imposes a sentence of fine or a sentence (including a sentence of death) of which fine forms a part,the Court may.
when passing judgment.
order the whole or any part of the fine recovered to be applied (a) in defraying the expenses properly incurred in the prosecution; PG NO 577 (b) in the payment to any person of compensation for any loss or injury caused by the offence.
when compensation is in the opinion of the Court, recoverable by such person in a civil Court; XXXXX XXXXX XXXX XXXXX XXXXX XXXXX (3) When a Court imposes a sentence, of which fine does not not form a part, the Court may, when passing judgment.
order the accused person to pay, by way of compensation.
such amount as may be specified in the order to the person who has suffered any loss or injury by reason of the act for which the accused person has been so sentenced.
(4) An order under this section may also be made by an Appellate Court or by the High Court or Court of Session when exercising its power of revision.
(5) At the time of awarding compensation in any subsequent civil suit relating to the same matter.
the Court shall take into account any sum paid or recovered as compensation under this section.
"" Sub section (1) of Section 357 provides power to award compensation to victims of the offence out of the sentence of fine imposed on accused.
In this case.
we are not concerned with sub section (1).
We are concerned only with sub section (3).
It is an important provision but Courts have seldom invoked it.
Perhaps due to ignorance of the object of it.
It empowers the Court to award compensation to victims while passing judgment of conviction.
In addition to conviction, the Court may order the accused to pay some amount by way of compensation to victim who has suffered by the action of accused.
It may be noted that this power of Courts to award compensation is not ancillary to other sentences but it is in addition thereto.
This power was intended to do something to re assure the victim that he or she is not forgotten in the criminal justice system.
It is a measure of responding appropriately to crime as well of reconciling the victim with the offender.
It is, to some extent.
a constructive approach to, crimes.
It is indeed a step forward in our criminal justice system.
We, therefore,recommend to all Courts to exercise this power liberally so as to meet the ends of justice in a better way.
PG NO 578 The payment by way of compensation must, however, be reasonable What is reasonable, may depend upon the facts and circumstances of each case.
The quantum of compensation may be determined by taking into account the nature of crime, the justness of claim by the victim and the ability of accused to pay.
If there are more than one accused they may be asked to pay in equal terms unless their capacity to pay varies considerably.
The payment may also vary depending upon the acts of each accused.
Reasonable period for payment of compensation, if necessary by installments, may also be given.
The Court may enforce the order by imposing sentence in default.
Joginder in this case is an unfortunate victim.
His power of speech has been permanently impaired.
Doctor has certified that he is unable to speak and that is why he has not stepped into the witness box for the prosecution.
The life long disability of the victim ought not to be bye passed by the Court.
He must be made to feel that the Court and accused have taken care of him.
Any such measure which would give him succor is far better than a sentence by deterrence.
The compensation awarded by the High Court, in our opinion, appears to be inadequate having regard to the nature of injury suffered by Joginder.
We have ascertained the means of accused and their ability to pay further sum to the victim.
We are told that they are not unwilling to bear the additional burden.
Mr. Lalit learned counsel said that his clients are willing to pay any amount determined by this Court.
It is indeed a good gesture on the part of counsel and his clients.
With due regard to all the facts and circumstances of the case, we consider that Rs.50,000 compensation to Joginder would meet the ends of justice.
We direct the respondents to pay the balance within two months in equal proportions.
The order of the High Court is modified only to the extent of Compensation as indicated above and in all other respects it is kept undisturbed.
The appeals are accordingly disposed of.
R.S.S. Appeals disposed of.
","Seven persons were convicted under sections 307/149, 325/l49, 3231/149 and 148 IPC and sentenced to undergo R.Z. from one year to three years.
The High Court acquitted two of all charges, and five of the offence under section 307/149 while maintaining their conviction and sentence under section 325/149, section 323/149 and section 148.
They were however released on probation of good conduct.
Each one of them was ordered to pay compensation of Rs. 2,500 to Joginder who was seriously injured and whose power of speech was permanently impaired.
Before this Court the appellant contended that the intention of the five accused was obviously to commit murder of Joginder and their acquittal under section 3O7 IPC was perverse.
Disposing of the appeal, it was, HELD: (1) Under section 307 IPC what the Court has to see is whether the act irrespective of its result, was done with the intention or knowledge and under circumstances mentioned in that section.
The intention or knowledge must be such as is necessary to constitute murder.
Without this ingredient being established there can be no offence of""attempt to murder"".
Under section 307 the intention precedes the act attributed to accused.
Therefore, the intention is to be gathered from all circumstances, and not merely from the consequences that ensue.
In this case, the respondents had no intention to commit murder.
They had no motive either.
[575F G] PG NO 571 PG NO 572 (2) Many offenders are not dangerous criminals but are weak characters or who have surrendered to temptation or provocation.
In placing such type of offenders on probation the Court encourages their own sense of responsibility for their future and protects them from the stigma and possible contamination of prison.
[576C D] (3) In this case, the High Court has observed that there was no previous history of enmity between the parties and the occurrence was an outcome of a sudden flare up.
The accused had no intention to commit murder of any person.
Therefore, the extension of benefit of the beneficial legislation applicable to first offenders cannot be said to be inappropriate.
l576D E] (4) Section 357 empowers the Court to award compensation to victims while passing judgment of conviction.
This power of Courts to award compensation to victims is not ancillary to other sentences but it is in addition thereto.
This power is intended to do something to reassure the victim that he or she is not forgotten in the criminal justice system.
It is recommended to all Courts to exercise this power liberally so as to meet the ends of justice in a better way.
[577F H] (5) The payment by way of compensation must be reasonable.
What is reasonable may depend upon the facts and circumstances of each case, e.g. the nature of crime, the justness of claim by the victim and the ability of the accused to pay etc.
On these considerations the Court enhanced the compensation to Rs. 50,000.
[578A B]
</s>","  This appeal by special leave is directed against the judgment of the High Court of Punjab and Haryana in Criminal Appeal No. 128 SP of 1984 whereby the High Court acquitted Sukhpal Singh and Surat Singh of all charges by giving them the benefit of doubt while maintaining the conviction and sentence of the other accused under sections 325/149, 323/149 and section 148 IPC.
The High Court ordered that the appellants namely Sukhbir Singh, Dhan Pal, Mannu, Siri Chand and Om Pal be released on probation on their entering into bonds of Rs.3,000 each with one surety in the like amount for a period of one year, to the satisfaction of the trial court, undertaking to appear in the court to receive the sentence during the said period whenever called upon to do so and in the meantime to keep peace and be of good behaviour.
However, each one of the appellant would pay Rs.2,500 as compensation payable to Joginder injured.
Compensation if not paid within two months, the appellants namely Sukhbir Singh, Dhan Pal, Mannu, Siri Chand and Om Pal would be called upon to serve their sentence.
But for this modification, appeal fails and is hereby dismissed.
In view of section 12 of the, no disqualification would attach to the appellants due to this conviction.
The facts leading to the conviction of the appellants have already been set out in the judgment of the High Court.

"<s>[INST] Summarize:Appeal No. 197 of 1956.
Appeal from the judgment and order dated August 6,1954, of the Bombay High Court in Appeal No. 30 of 1954, arising out of the judgment and order dated January 28, 1954, of the said High Court in Insolvency No. 74 of 1951.
1385 M. C. Setalvad, Attorney General for India, section N. Andley and J. B. Dadachanji, for the appellants.
Purshottam Tricumdas and I. N. Shroff, for the respondent.
February 20.
The following Judgment of the Court was delivered by GAJENDRAGADKAR J.
This appeal by special leave arises from the notice of motion taken out by the respondent official assignee under section 55 of the Presidency towns Insolvency Act against the appellants for a declaration that a deed of gift executed by the insolvent Daulatram Hukamchand on May 22, 1950, in favour of the appellants was void.
It appears that some creditors of Daulatram filed a petition in the High Court of Judicature at Bombay, Insolvency Case No. 74 of 1.951, for an order that the said Daulatram be adjudged insolvent as he had given notice of suspension of payment of the debts on August 2, 1951.
Daulatram was adjudicated in solvent on August 21, 1951, with the result that the estate of the insolvent vested in the respondent under section 17 of the Act.
On September 26, 1951, the respondent took out the present notice of motion.
The impugned deed of gift has been executed by the insolvent in favour of his wife and three sons who are the appellants before us.
In reply to the notice of motion appellants I to 3 filed a joint affidavit setting out the facts and circumstances under which the said deed of gift had been executed by the insolvent in their favour.
In substance, the appellants ' case was that, though the document purported to be a gift, it was really a transaction supported by valuable con sideration and as such it did not fall within the mischief of section 55 of the Act.
At the hearing of this notice of motion before Mr. Justice Coyajee, when the appellants sought to lead evidence in support of this plea, the respondent objected and urged that the evidence which the appellants wanted to lead was inadmissible under section 92 of the Indian Evidence Act.
The learned Judge, however, overruled the respondent 's objection and allowed the appellants to lead 1386 their evidence.
In the end the learned Judge did not accept the appellants ' contention and, by his judgment delivered on January 28, 1954, he granted the declaration claimed by the respondent under section 55 of the Act.
Against this judgment and order the appellants preferred an appeal (No. 30 of 1954) which was heard by Chagla C. J. and Shah J.
The learned Judges took the view that Mr. Justice Coyajee had erred in law in allowing oral evidence to be led by the appellants in support of their plea that the transaction evidenced by the deed of gift was in reality a transfer for consideration.
The learned Judges held that the gift in question had been executed by the donor in favour of the donees out of natural love and affection and that, under section 92, it was not open to the appellants to lead evidence to show that the transaction was supported not by the consideration of natural love and affection but by another kind of valuable consideration .
On this view of the matter the learned Judges did not think it necessary to consider the oral evidence actually led by the appellants and decide whether Mr. Justice Coyajee was right or not in rejecting the said evidence on the merits.
That is how the appeal preferred by the appellants was dismissed on August 6, 1964.
On September 23, 1954, the application made by the appellants for a certificate was rejected by the High Court at Bombay; but special leave was granted to the appellants by this Court on November 3, 1954, and that is how the appeal has come before us for final disposal.
The principal point which arises in this appeal is whether the appellants were entitled to lead oral evidence with a view to show the real nature of the impugned transaction.
In deciding this question, it would be necessary to consider the true scope and effect of sections 91 and 92 of the Evidence Act.
Chapter VI of the Evidence Act which begins with section 91 deals with the exclusion of oral by documentary evidence.
Section 91 provides that, "" when the terms of a contract, or of a grant, or of any other disposition of property, have been reduced to the form of a document, 1387 and in all cases in which any matter is required by law to be reduced to the form of a document, no evidence shall be given in proof of the terms of such contract, grant or other disposition of property, or of such matter, except the document itself, or secondary evidence of its contents in cases in which secondary As, evidence is admissible under the provisions hereinbefore contained.
"" The normal rule is that the contents of a document must be proved by primary evidence which is the document itself in original.
Section 91 is based on what is sometimes described as the "" best evidence rule "".
The best evidence about the contents of a document is the document itself and it is the production of the document that is required by section 91 in proof of its contents.
In a sense, the rule enunciated by section 91 can be said to be an exclusive rule inasmuch as it excludes the admission of oral evidence for proving the contents of the document except in cases where secondary evidence is allowed to be led under the relevant provisions of the Evidence Act.
Section 92 excludes the evidence of oral agreements and it applies to cases where the terms of contracts, grants or other dispositions of property have been proved by the production of the relevant documents themselves under section 91 ; in other words ' it is after the document has been produced to prove its terms under section 91 that the provisions of section 92 come into operation for the purpose of excluding evidence of any oral agreement or statement, for the purpose of contradicting, varying, adding to or subtracting from its terms.
The application of this rule is limited to cases as between parties to the instrument or their representatives in interest.
There are six provisos to this section with which we are not concerned in the present appeal.
It would be noticed that sections 91 and 92 in effect supplement each other.
Section 91 would be frustrated without the aid of section 92 and section 92 would be inoperative without the aid of section 91.
Since section 92 excludes the admission of oral evidence for the purpose of contradicting, varying, adding to or subtracting from the terms of the document properly proved 176 1388 under section 91, it may be said that it makes the proof of the document conclusive of its contents.
Like section 91, section 92 also can be said to be based oil the best evidence rule.
The two sections, however, differ in some material particulars.
Section 91 applies to all documents, whether they purport to dispose of rights or not, whereas section 92 applies to documents which can be described as dispositive.
Section 91 applies to documents which are both bilateral and unilateral, unlike section 92 the application of which is confined only to bilateral documents.
Section 91 lays down the rule of universal application and is not confined to the executant or executants of the documents.
Section 92, on the other hand, applies only between the parties to the instrument or their representatives in interest.
There is no doubt that section 92 does not apply to strangers who are not bound or affected by the terms of the document.
Persons other than those who are parties to the document are not precluded from giving extrinsic evidence to contradict, vary, add to or subtract from the terms of the document.
It is only where a question arises about the effect of the document as between the parties or their representatives in interest that the rule enunciated by section 92 about the exclusion of oral agreement can be invoked.
This position is made absolutely clear by the provisions of section 99 itself.
Section 99 provides that "" persons who are not parties to a document or their representatives in interest may give evidence of any facts tending to show a contemporaneous agreement varying the terms of the document.
"" Though it is only variation which is specifically mentioned in section 99, there can be no doubt that the third party 's right to lead evidence which is recognized by section 99 would include, a right to lead evidence not only to vary the terms of the document, but to contradict the said terms or to add to or subtract from them.
If that be the true position, before considering the effect of the provisions of section 92 in regard to the appellants ' right to lead oral evidence, it would be necessary to examine whether section 92 applies at all to the present proceedings between the official assignee who is the respondent and the 1389 donees from the insolvent who are the appellants before us.
Does the official assignee represent the insolvent, and can he be described as the representative ininterest of the insolvent, when he moves the Insolvency Court under section 55 of the Presidency towns Insolvency Act ? It is true that, under section 17 of the Act, on the making of an order of adjudication, the property of the insolvent wherever situate vests in the official assignee and becomes divisible among his creditors; but the property in respect of which a declaration is claimed by the official assignee under section 55 has already gone out of the estate of the insolvent, and it cannot be said to vest in the official assignee as a result of the order of adjudication itself.
Besides, when the official assignee makes the petition under section 55 he does so obviously and solely for the benefit of the creditors.
An insolvent himself has, and can possibly have, no right to challenge the transfer effected by him.
In this respect the official assignee has a higher title than the insolvent and, when, under section 55, he challenges any transfer made by the insolvent, he acts not for the insolvent or on his behalf, but in the interest of the whole body of the insolvent 's creditors.
In theory and on principle, as soon as an order of adjudication is made, all proceedings in regard to the estate of the insolvent come under the control of the Insolvency Court.
It may be said that the official assignee in whom the estate of the insolvent vests is to guard not only the interests of the creditors of the insolvent but also "" public morality and the interest which every member of the public has in the observance of commercial morality ""(1).
There is no doubt that it is the Insolvency Court alone which has jurisdiction to annul the insolvent 's transactions, whether the case is governed by the Presidency towns Insolvency Act or by the Provincial Insolvency Act; and so the proceedings taken under section 55 cannot be deemed to be proceedings taken for and on behalf of the insolvent at all.
(1) "" The Law of Insolvency in India "" By Rt.
Sir D. F. Mulla, Kt. 2nd Ed., p. 231.
1390 The provisions of section 55 themselves support the same conclusion.
Under section 55, any transfer of property not being a transfer made before and in consideration of marriage or made in favour of a purchaser or encumbrancer in good faith and for valuable consideration shall, if the transferor is adjudged insolvent within two years of the date of transfer, be void against the official assignee.
This section, like section 53 A of the Provincial Insolvency Act, makes the impugned transfers voidable at the instance of the official assignee or the receiver.
The transfers in question are not declared void as between the parties themselves; they are avoided by the official assignee or the receiver and their avoidance is intended to enure for the benefit of the whole body of the creditors of the insolvent.
The relevant sections of the two Insolvency Acts in effect require the Insolvency Courts to set aside the impugned transactions in exercise of the Insolvency Courts ' exclusive jurisdiction in that behalf The obvious object of these provisions is to bring back to the insolvent 's estate, property which has left the estate by the impugned act of the insolvent himself and make the said property available for distribution amongst his creditors.
It would, therefore, be impossible to hold that, when the official assignee makes a petition under section 55 of the Act, he is acting as a representative ininterest of the insolvent.
In this connection it would be relevant to remember that, in cases governed by the Presidency towns Insolvency Act, the practice in Calcutta and Bombay consistently allows a creditor who has proved his debt to file a petition to set aside the transfer under section 55 of the Act if he shows that the official assignee, on being tendered a reasonable indemnity has unreasonably refused to make an application.
Similarly, under section 54 A of the Provincial Insolvency Act, a creditor himself can make the application if the receiver refuses to take any action.
Now, if an application is made by a creditor for setting aside a voluntary transfer effected by the insolvent, there can be no doubt that the creditor is not the representative 1391 in interest of the insolvent and the creditor would obviously not be affected by the provisions of section 92 of the Indian Evidence Act.
It would really be anomalous if section 92 were to apply to proceedings instituted by the official assignee under section 55 though the said section cannot and would not apply to similar proceedings instituted by a creditor.
Having regard to the object with which section 55 has been enacted, the nature of the proceedings taken under it, and the nature and effect of the final order which is contemplated under it, it is clear that, like the creditor who may apply, the official assignee also cannot be said to be the representative in interest of the insolvent in these proceedings.
If that be the true position, section 92 cannot apply to the present proceedings between the respondent and the appellants; and so there can be no doubt that the respondent would not be precluded from leading evidence of an oral agreement for the purpose of contradicting, varying, adding to or subtracting from the terms of the impugned document.
The question raised by Shri Purushottam which still remains to be considered is whether the appellants who undoubtedly are the representatives in interest of the insolvent can avoid the application of a. 92.
In our opinion, the answer to this question must be in favour of the appellants.
It is urged before us by Shri Purushottam that the scheme of the relevant provisions of Ch.
VI of the Indian Evidence Act is inconsistent with the appellants ' contention that they can lead oral evidence about the alleged agreement which may tend to change the character of the transaction itself.
Shri Purushottam bases his argument mainly on the provisions of section 91 read with section 99 of the Act.
He contends that section 91 requires the production and proof of the document itself for the purpose of proving the contents of the document; and by necessary implication all evidence about any oral agreement which may affect the terms of the document is excluded by section 91 itself.
We are not impressed by this argument.
As we have already observed, sections 91 and 92 really supplement each other.
It is because section 91 by itself would not have excluded 1392 evidence of oral agreements which may tend to vary the terms of the document that section 92 has been enacted; and if section 92 does not apply in the present case, there is no other section in the Evidence Act which can be said to exclude evidence of the agreement set up by the appellants.
What section 91 prohibits is the admission of oral evidence to prove the contents of the document.
In the present case, the terms of the document are proved by the production of the document itself.
Whether or not the said terms could be varied by proof of an oral agreement is a matter which is not covered by section 91 at all.
That is the subject matter of section 92; and so, if section 92 does not apply, there is no reason to exclude evidence about an oral agreement solely on the ground that if believed the said evidence may vary the terms of the transaction.
Shri Purushottam 'also relied upon the provi sions of section 99.
His argument is that it is only persons who are not parties to a document or their representatives in interest who are allowed by section 99 to give evidence of facts tending to show a contemporaneous agreement varying the terms of the document.
lit other words, the effect of section 99 is not only to allow strangers to lead such evidence, but to prohibit parties or their representatives in interest from leading such evidence independently of tile provisions of section 92 of the Evidence Act.
We do not read section 99 as laying down any such prohibition by necessary implication.
As a matter of fact, from the terms of section 92 itself, it is clear that strangers to the document are outside the scope of section 92 ; but section 99 has presumably been enacted to clarify the same position.
It would be unreasonable, we think, to hold that section 99 was intended not only to clarify the position with regard to the strangers to the document, but also to lay down a rule of exclusion of oral evidence by implication in respect of the parties to the document or their representatives in interest.
In our opinion, the true position is that, if the terms of any transfer reduced to writing are in dispute between a stringer to a document and a party to it or his representative in interest, the restriction imposed by section 92 in regard to 1393 the exclusion of evidence of oral agreement is inapplicable; and both the stranger to the document arid the party to the document or his representative in interest are at liberty to lead evidence of oral agreement notwithstanding the fact that such evidence, if believed, may contradict, vary, add to or subtract from its terms.
The rule of exclusion enun ciated by section 92 applies to both parties to the document and is based on the doctrine of mutuality.
It would be inequitable and unfair to enforce that rule against a party to a document or his representative in interest in the case of a dispute between the said.
party or his representative in interest on the one hand and the stranger on the other.
In dealing with this point we may incidentally refer to the relevant statement of the law by Phipson in his treatise on "" Evidence"": "" Where the transaction has been reduced into writing merely by agreement of the parties "", it is observed, "" extrinsic evidence to contradict or vary the writing is excluded only in proceedings between such parties or their privies, and not in those between strangers, or a party and a stranger; since strangers cannot be precluded from proving the truth by the ignorance, carelessness, or fraud of the parties (R. vs Cheadle, 3 B. and Ad. 833); nor, in proceedings between a party and a stranger, will the former be estopped, since there would be no mutuality "" (1).
The result is that section 92 is wholly inapplicable to the present proceedings and so the appellants are entitled to lead evidence in support of the plea raised by them.
It appears that the attention of the learned Judges who heard the appeal in the High Court at Bombay was not drawn to this aspect of the matter.
That is why they proceeded to deal with the question about the admissibility of oral evidence led by the appellants on the assumption that section 92 applied.
We must accordingly set aside the decree passed by the court of appeal in the High Court at Bombay and send the appeal back to that Court for disposal on the merits in accordance with law.
In the circum (1) Phipson on Evidence 9th Ed., p. 602.
1394 stances of this case, we think that the fair order as to costs of this appeal would be that the costs should abide the final result in the appeal before the High Court at Bombay.
Appeal allowed.
Case remanded.
","One D executed, on May 22, 1950, a deed of gift in favour of the appellants, his wife and sons.
Upon the application of his creditors D was adjudged an insolvent on August 21, 1951 and his estate vested in the respondent.
On September 26, 1951, the respondent took out a notice of motion under section 55 of the Presidency towns Insolvency Act for a declaration that the deed of gift was void.
In reply the appellants pleaded that the transaction, though it purported to be a gift, was in reality a transfer for valuable consideration.
The respondent objected that the evidence which the appellants sought to lead in support of their plea was inadmissible under section 92 of the Indian Evidence Act : Held, that section 92 of the Evidence Act was not applicable to the proceedings and the appellants were entitled to lead evidence in support of the plea raised by them.
Section 92 is only applicable to cases as between parties to an instrument or their representatives in interest.
Where, however the dispute is between a stranger to an instrument and a party to it or his representative in interest, section 92 is inapplicable, and both the stranger and the party or his representative are at liberty to lead evidence of oral agreement notwithstanding the fact that such evidence if believed, may contradict, vary, add to or subtract from its terms.
In the present case, though the appellants were the representatives in interest of the insolvent, the respondent, when he made the petition under section 55 of the Presidency towns Insolvency Act, was not acting as a representative in interest of the insolvent, and, therefore, the proceedings were not between the parties to the instrument or their representatives in interest.
</s>","  The principal point which arises in this appeal is whether the appellants were entitled to lead oral evidence with a view to show that the transaction evidenced by the deed of gift was in reality a transfer for consideration.
The relevant provisions of the Presidency towns Insolvency Act are section 55(1), section 92 and section 93.
Section 55(1) provides that ""if any property of the insolvent has been transferred or disposed of by him without receiving adequate consideration therefor, the court may declare that such transfer or disposition is void."" Section 92 provides that ""no oral agreement for the sale, mortgage, lease, exchange, gift or other alienation of immovable property shall be admitted as evidence unless the written agreement containing the terms of the contract or some memorandum or note thereof is signed by the parties to the agreement or by their agents acting on their behalf."" Section 93 provides that ""the court may, if it thinks fit, require any party to give security for costs."" 1387 The appellants'contention is that the transaction evidenced by the deed of gift was in reality a transfer for consideration and that therefore they were entitled to lead oral evidence to prove that the transaction was not a gift but a transfer for consideration.
The respondent's contention is that the transaction was a genuine gift and that therefore the appellants were not entitled to lead oral evidence to prove that the transaction was not a gift but a transfer for consideration.
We have carefully considered the contentions of both sides and we are of opinion that the transaction evidenced by the deed of gift was in reality a transfer for consideration and that therefore the appellants were entitled to lead oral evidence to prove that the transaction was not a gift but a transfer for consideration.
The appellants'case is that the transaction was a transfer for consideration because the insolvent had received valuable consideration for the same.
The appellants'contention is that the insolvent had received valuable consideration for the gift inasmuch as the gift was made by the insolvent in favour of his wife and three sons who are the appellants before us.

Bachan Singh vs State of Punjab, Supreme Court of India, August 16, 1982, Case No. Writ Petition (Criminal) No. 67 of 1978

","In the light of Bachan Singh vs State of Punjab, a public interest litigation (PIL) could be formulated questioning the discretion provided to judges in applying the death penalty. This PIL could argue that the lack of strict guidelines and criteria for the application of capital punishment could lead to inconsistent rulings, posing a risk of violation of Article 14 (Right to Equality) of the Constitution. It could further contend that India should move towards more humane methods of punishment and call for a comprehensive review and overhaul of the current criminal sentencing policies.</s>","A potential public interest litigation could be filed to challenge the constitutionality of the death penalty in India. The petitioner could argue that the death penalty violates the right to life and personal liberty guaranteed under Article 21 of the Constitution. It could also be argued that the death penalty is not a just or proportionate punishment for crimes committed by individuals, especially when compared to other forms of punishment such as life imprisonment. Furthermore, it could be contended that the death penalty does not serve as a deterrent to crime, but rather perpetuates a cycle of violence and retribution. The litigation could seek to strike down the death penalty as unconstitutional and advocate for alternative forms of punishment that prioritize rehabilitation and restorative justice. Additionally, the litigation could aim to raise awareness about the need for reforming the criminal justice system to ensure fairness, equality, and human rights for all individuals. This would involve engaging with relevant stakeholders, conducting research and gathering evidence to support the arguments, and presenting them effectively before the court. Overall, the goal of this public interest litigation would be to bring attention to the issue of capital punishment and push for its abolition in India."

From the Judgment and Decree dated 21 12 1965 of the Kerala High Court in A.S. No. 403 of 1961.
1135 P. Govindan Nair, C. section Ananthakrishna Iyer, section Balakrishnan and Mrs. Baby Krishnan, for the Appellant.

E. M. section Anam and P. N. Pura for Respondent No. 9.
The Judgment of the Court was delivered by DESAI, J.
On a certificate granted by the Full Bench of the High Court of Kerala, original plaintiff, a Hindu widow who was seeking partition of a share to which her deceased husband was entitled, having lost in both the Courts, has filed this appeal.
The High Court granted the certificate under Article 133(1)(c) of the Constitution as in its opinion the following substantial questions of law arise from the judgment rendered by it: 1.
Whether under the Mitakshara Law the parties are governed by customary law, and, in the absence of any rule of customary law on the point in question, by Mitakshara Law property can be divided, albeit by a family settlement, between two artificial units of a joint family, one comprising the sons of a father by his first wife, the first wife and his step mother, and the other comprising his son by his second wife and the second wife so as to constitute each unit into a coparcenary with rights of survivorship between its members; and 2.
Whether the use of the word 'tavazhi ' (in any case a misnomer) in describing the two units in the will, Ext.
P 1 left by the father and held to be the basis of the family settlement, is sufficient in the circumstances, to establish an intention that the members of each unit were to take the property as coparceners and not as tenants in common, the grouping into units being only for convenient enjoyment? The factual background from which, according to the High Court the aforementioned two questions emerge for consideration of this Court may be stated.
One Karappan, son of Chulliparambil Krishnan, had two wives Nani and Ponni.
Defendant 1 Krishnan, defendant 2 Shankaran, one Raman, husband of plaintiff Kallyani, and deceased Madhavan, husband of defendant 3 and father of defendants 4, 5 and 6, were his sons by first wife Nani, and one Kesavan was his son by the second wife Ponni.
He had six daughters, four by the first wife and 1136 two by the second wife.
One Valli was the second wife of his father and she had three daughters.
Karappan and his family are Ezhavas and in the matter of inheritance, succession and on the question of personal law they were governed essentially by customary law and in the absence of any specific custom they are governed by the Hindu Mitakshara Law.
Karappan executed a registered deed variously described as a will or a deed of partition or evidencing family arrangement, Ext.
P 1 dated January 25, 1910, the salient features of which may be reproduced.
After narrating his near relations including his two wives, male and female children born to each and his father 's second wife and her children, the following recitals are worthy of note: ""There are as belonging to me now properties to the value of Rs. 8000/ mentioned in the sub joined schedules A and B as my tarwad properties and also my self acquired properties and properties to the value of Rs. 200/ of the C schedule which is set apart as common properties"".
""Since I am seriously ill and in order that there may not arise any dispute in future in respect of properties belonging to me, I have resolved today the following with regard to the course of enjoyment of the said properties after my death"".
""I myself shall have the full powers of disposition over all the properties described in A, B and C schedules during my life time and after my death, out of the properties to the value of Rs. 8000/ , Rs. 1300/ worth of properties shall vest in each of my male issues, Rs. 300/ in my first wife, Rs. 1000/ in my second wife since she is sick and Rs. 200/ in my father 's second wife"".
""On the above basis I have set apart to be vested in them after my death Rs. 5200/ worth of properties to the first tavazhi male issues, Rs. 300/ to my first wife and Rs. 200/ to my father 's wife, altogether properties worth Rs. 5700/ scheduled to A schedule; Rs. 1300/ worth of properties comprising items 1 to 4 and 6 to 12 of B schedule to the second tavazhi, inclusive of an owelty of Rs. 227 as.
5 decided to be paid by the first tavazhi to the second tavazhi, and item 5 of B schedule worth Rs. 1000/ to my second wife"". ""And that 1/5th share of assessment of C schedule property shall be paid annually by Kesavan in the Amsom and receipt obtained"".
1137 ""It is also resolved that each tavazhi shall meet the travelling expenses of female issues and maintain properly the women who return on the death of their husbands, that both tavazhis shall equally maintain the children of my aunt and my sister and that since C schedule properties are partitioned now, all my male issues shall have equal rights over the property after my death"".
This is a registered deed.
Soon thereafter, in February 1910, Karappan died.
Raman, the husband of the plaintiff, the third son of the first wife, died on February 20, 1936.
Plaintiff widow of Raman sued for partition and separate possession of her undivided 1/4 share in properties set out in A, B and C schedules to the plaint.
It is necessary to clarify here that there were A, B and C schedules annexed to Ext.
P 1 which, for clarity of understanding, would be referred to as the Will of the deceased though it would be presently pointed out that it is ineffective as a Will.
Schedules A and B to Ext.
P 1 specify certain properties.
Properties set out in schedule B to Ext.
P 1 except item No. 5 were awarded to Kesavan, the son by the second wife, and item No. 5 to the second wife.
Properties in schedule A to Ext.
P 1 subject to adjustment pointed out in Ext.
P 1 were given to the first wife and her sons.
Properties set out in schedule C to Ext.
P 1 were kept undivided and were the subject matter of another suit filed by the present plaintiff which has ended in a decree in her favour and which decree has become final.
On the other hand, properties set out in schedule A to the plaint are the very properties which are shown in schedule A to Ext.
In respect of properties set out in the schedule B to the plaint it is alleged that they were acquired by the joint labour of defendants 1 and 2, deceased Raman and Madhavan, and it is equally true of properties set out in schedule C to the plaint but they were separately set out because they stood in the name of the wife of defendant 1.
Plaintiff, however, claimed 1/4 of her share in all the properties set out in schedules A, B and C to the plaint.
The suit was principally resisted by defendant 1 as per his written statement dated July 12, 1958.
It was in terms contended that the properties dealt with by Ext.
P 1 were the joint family properties of Karappan and his sons and that Karappan was not entitled to and had no authority in law to execute a Will in respect of the properties.
There is an averment which may be extracted.
It reads: ""Even though Karappan has no right to execute the Will accordingly, what Karappan actually did was that he parti 1138 tioned the properties between the two tavazhies in order to avoid future quarrel between the two wives and their children.
As a father he has got the right to partition his properties according to the custom of the community and according to the Mitakshara law, that Will would be valid as a deed of partition and accordingly accepting the same later, properties had been taken possession by the two tavazhies separately.
Even though the execution of such a deed was against procedure, it was in order to honour the wishes of deceased Karappan that the same was acted upon"".
In respect of plaint B schedule properties, the contention was that it was acquired by the private income of the first defendant and that schedule 'C ' properties belonged to the wife of defendant 1 and that plaintiff has no share in it.
It was also contended that as the four sons by the first wife of Karappan constituted a tavazhi, it has all the incidents of a coparcenary and, therefore, succession was governed by survivorship and hence the plaintiff has no share in schedule A properties.
The trial Court framed as many as 12 issues.
The important findings of the Trial Court are that Ext.
P 1 is neither effective as a Will nor as a deed of partition.
Without specifically so saying that Ext.
P 1 would be effective as a family arrangement, it was held that Ext.
P 1 had the effect of constituting a coparcenary of four brothers, sons of first wife of Karappan and that it was their joint family property and they did not hold as tenants in common but as joint tenants and were governed by survivorship in the matter of succession.
The contention that even in such a situation the widow would be entitled to her share because of a customary right was negatived.
In respect of B and C schedule properties it was held that they belonged exclusively to defendant 1 and his wife and plaintiff cannot claim a share in them.
Consistent with these findings, the plaintiff 's suit was dismissed.
A Full Bench of the Kerala High Court heard the first appeal preferred by the plaintiff.
The High Court substantially agreed with the findings of the trial Court and specifically held that Ext.
P 1 furnished important evidence of a family arrangement accepted and acted upon by all the parties affected thereby.
It was held that as family arrangement it is binding and it indicated that the division was per branches, therefore, the four sons by the first wife of Karappan divided as one branch and one son alone by the second wife separated as a different branch and as four sons by the first wife constituted a joint family, succession would be governed by survivorship and the plaintiff is not entitled to claim any share in schedule A properties.
1139 On the question of acquisition of schedule B and C properties, the finding of the trial Court was confirmed.
It may be mentioned that plaintiff had filed another suit for partition of properties set out in C Schedule to Ext.
P 1 and that suit was decreed in plaintiff 's favour and that decree has become final.
Two questions of general importance framed by the High Court are rather involved and confusing and do not pinpoint the attention on questions of law emerging from the judgment of the High Court.
The first question that needs to be answered is whether Ext.
P 1 styled as a Will by the deceased Karappan would be effective as a Will.
If by Ext.
P 1 deceased Karappan attempted to make a Will of the ancestral property in his hand in which his sons had acquired interest by birth, obviously he had no power to make a Will in respect of such property.
P 1 does not purport to devise by Will the individual share of testator Karappan in the joint family property but he attempts to make a will of all the properties, ancestral and self acquired and even to dispose of property in which his sons had interest by birth, by will.
He has not claimed any share in the property but claimed a right to deal with ancestral property as he desired.
In Ext.
P 1 itself he describes properties set out in schedules A and B annexed to Ext.
P 1 as his tarvad properties.
Expression 'tarvad ' in Marumakkattayam Law is the name given to the joint family consisting of males and females, all descended in the female line from a common ancestress.
A tarvad may consist of two or more branches known as thavazhies; each tavazhi or branch consisting of one of the female members of the tarvad and her decendents in the female line (see Mayne 's Hindu Law and Usage, 11th Edn., pp. 792 93.) Thus when property is described as tarvad property in a broad sense it is admitted to be joint family property.
This also becomes clear from the recital in Ext.
P 1 that properties in A and B schedules were tarvad properties and property in C schedule were claimed by him as his self acquired properties and they were to be kept joint and were not sought to be dealt with by Ext.
Therefore, to the extent Ext.
P 1 purports to dispose of ancestral properties by will it would be ineffective as a will as testator Karappan had no power or authority to dispose of by will ancestral properties in his hand.
And as he has not attempted to dispose of his undivided share in the ancestral properties by Ext.
P 1 it is not necessary here to examine the question whether Mitakshara law as administered in Tamil Nadu and Kerala enables an undivided coparcener to dispose of his share in joint family property by will.
Therefore, Ext.
P 1 is not effective as a will and 1140 the respondents did not invite us to affirm their rights under Ext.
P 1 as if it is a binding will.
The next stage in the unfolding of the case is whether Ext.
P 1 is effective as a partition.
Partition is a word of technical import in Hindu law.
Partition in one sense is a severance of joint status and coparcener of a coparcenary is entitled to claim it as a matter of his individual volition.
In this narrow sense all that is necessary to constitute partition is a definite and unequivocal indication of his intention by a member of a joint family to separate himself from the family and enjoy his share in severalty.
Such an unequivocal intention to separate brings about a disruption of joint family status, at any rate, in respect of separating member or members and thereby puts an end to the coparcenary with right of survivorship and such separated member holds from the time of disruption of joint family as tenant in common.
Such partition has an impact on devolution of shares of such members.
It goes to his heirs displacing survivorship.
Such partition irrespective of whether it is accompanied or followed by division of properties by metes and bounds covers both a division of right and division of property (see Approviar vs Rama Subha Aiyar quoted with approval in Smt.
Krishnabai Bhritar Ganpatrao Deshmukh vs Appasaheb Tuljaramarao Nimbalkar & Ors.
A disruption of joint family status by a definite and unequivocal indication to separate implies separation in interest and in right, although not immediately followed by a de facto actual division of the subject matter.
This may at any time, be claimed by virtue of the separate right (see Girja Bai vs Sadashiv.
A physical and actual division of property by metes and bounds follows from disruption of status and would be termed partition in a broader sense.
There was some controversy whether a Hindu father governed by Mitakshara law has a right to partition ancestral properties without the consent of his sons.
After referring to Mitakshara, I, ii, 2, Mayne in 'Hindu Law & Usage ', 11th Edn.
p. 547, states that a Hindu father under the Mitakshara Law can effect a partition between himself and his sons as also between his sons inter se without their consent and that not only can he partition the property acquired by himself but also the ancestral property.
The relevant text may be extracted: ""The father has power to effect a division not only between himself and his sons but also between the sons 1141 inter se.
The power extends not only to effecting a division by metes and bounds but also to a division of status"".
Similarly, in Mulla 's Hindu Law, 14th Edn., p. 410 (para 323), it is stated that the father of a joint family has the power to divide the family property at any moment during his life time provided he gives his sons equal shares with himself, and if he does so, the effect in law is not only a separation of the father from the sons, but a separation of the sons inter se.
The consent of the sons is not necessary for the exercise of that power.
It, therefore, undoubtedly appears that Hindu father joint with his sons governed by Mitakshara law has the power to partition the joint family property at any moment during his life time.
Mr. Krishnamoorty Iyer urged that even though undoubtedly a Hindu father joint with his sons and governed by Mitakshara law has the power to partition the joint family property, this power enables him to partition the property by metes and bounds but he has no power merely to disrupt the joint family status unaccompanied by division of property by metes and bounds.
The limited question that needs answer in this case is whether a Hindu father joint with his sons governed by Mitakshara law has the power to disrupt the joint family status being a first step in the stage of dividing the property by metes and bounds.
The wider question whether a coparcener of a coparcenary governed by Mitakshara law brings about a disruption of joint family status by definite and unequivocal indication of his intention to separate himself from the family would constitute disruption of status qua the non separating members need not be examined.
A Hindu father joint with his sons and governed by Mitakshara law in contradistinction to other manager of a Hindu undivided family or an ordinary coparcener enjoys the larger power to impose a partition on his sons with himself as well as amongst his sons inter se without their consent and this larger power to divide the property by metes and bounds and to allocate the shares to each of his sons and to himself would certainly comprehend within its sweep the initial step, viz., to disrupt the joint family status which must either precede or be simultaneously taken with partition of property by metes and bounds.
This view taken in Kandaswami vs Doraiswami Ayyar; does not appear to have been departed from.
Further, the text from Mayne 's book extracted in the preceding paragraph shows that the weight of authority is against the proposition canvassed for by Mr. Iyer.
It does, therefore, appear that a Hindu father governed by 1142 Mitakshara law has power to partition the joint family property belonging to the joint family consisting of himself and his sons and that this power comprehends the power to disrupt joint family status.
The question is, has Karappan as father exercised his power to partition the joint family property by Ext.
P 1 ? Even though the father has a right to make a partition of the joint family property in his hand, he has no right to make a partition by will of joint family property amongst various members of the family except, of course, if it could be made with their consent (see Brijraj Singh vs Sheodan Singh.
Whether it is effective as family arrangement will be presently examined.
Therefore, if by Ext.
P 1 Karappan attempted to make a partition of the property by his will, Ext.
P 1 would be ineffective as a partition.
By Ext.
P 1 Karappan does not divide his property by metes and bounds vesting the share of each in presenti in each of his sons.
One thing that is not in dispute is that Karappan did not intend Ext.
P 1 to be effective from the date on which it was executed.
In his own words he states that he was seriously ill and as he would like to avoid a dispute in future in respect of his properties and, therefore, he resolved that his property shall be enjoyed after his death in the manner stated in Ext.
He reserved to himself the full powers of disposition over all the properties more particularly described in the various schedules annexed to Ext.
P 1 during his life time and whatever directions were given in Ext.
P 1 were to be effective only after his death.
At two places in terms he stated that the dispositions made by Ext.
P 1 were to be effective after his death.
It is, therefore, inescapable that Ext.
P 1 was not to be effective as a partition in broader sense, namely, dividing property by metes and bounds from the date on which it was executed.
It was to be effective from a future date and that future uncertain event was the death of Karappan and that during the time he would remain alive he would deal with the properties at his sweet will.
Further, there was no effective partition by metes and bounds by Ext.
P 1 though the shares of sons were specified as also the provision for female members was made.
If intention of the testator is to be gathered from the language of Ext.
P 1 Karappan intended it to be a will to be effective after his death.
He never intended it to be a partition in presenti.
Therefore, Ext.
P 1 cannot be effective as a deed of partition in the broader sense, i.e. partition by metes and bounds.
What then is the effective of Ext.
P 1 on the joint family of which Karappan was father cum manager ? The respondents contend that 1143 it is a family arrangement providing for carving out branchwise (shakha per wife) separation of interest in the joint family properties and as it was unreservedly accepted by all affected thereby after the death of Karappan, it is binding on all.
Appellant contends that Ext.
P 1 had the effect of disrupting the joint family status and from that date members of the joint family entitled to their shares in the joint family property, held as tenants in common and not as joint tenant with the result that inheritance by survivorship, a special feature of a Hindu coparcenary, would be displaced by Hindu law of succession, the property going to the heirs recognised by law.
Defendant 1 who contested the suit in terms stated that Ext.
P 1 was not effective as a will.
He than stated that Ext.
P 1 purports to partition the property between the two tavazhies represented by Karappan 's two wives and their respective male offspring.
It may, however, be stated that nowhere in the written statement he has put forth the contention that Ext.
P 1 evidences a family arrangement assented to by all affected thereby.
That case appears to have been made out by the High Court for the first time and since the plaintiff has been non suited on the finding that Ext.
P 1 was a family arrangement which provided for a coparcenary of four sons of the first wife of Karappan, retaining inheritance by survivorship amongst the four members it is necessary to examine the contention whether Ext.
P 1 provides for a family arrangement assented to by all concerned.
An ineffective will sometimes though not always, if otherwise consented by all adult members, may be effective as a family arrangement but as the father of a joint Hindu family has no power to impose a family arrangement under the guise of exercising the power of partition, the power which undoubtedly he has but which he has failed to effectively exercise, cannot in the absence of consent of all male members bind them as a family arrangement.
What constitutes family arrangement has been fully examined by this Court in M. N. Aryamurthy & Anr.
vs M. D. Subbaraya Setty (dead) through I.r. & Ors.
Broadly stated, it is that there must be an agreement amongst the various members of the family intended to be generally and reasonably for the benefit of the family and secondly the agreement should be with the object either of compromising doubtful or disputed rights or for preserving the family property or the place and security of the family.
Both these ingredients appear to be absent in this case.
In Brijraj Singh 's case (supra) a father purported to make a will in which he recorded a partition of the joint family property amongst his three sons.
He did not take a share for himself and simultan 1144 eously gave double share to his eldest son.
There were usual recitals of partition and allotment of shares and it was further stated that in anticipation of execution of the deed various sharers were put in possession of property allotted to each of them.
This was done two months prior to the execution of the so called will.
The document was held ineffective as a will but on evidence it was found that all concerned had acquiesced in the arrangement evidenced by the deed and the deed was intended to operate from the date of its execution and, therefore, it evidenced a family arrangement contemporaneously made and acted upon by all the parties and hence binding.
Similarly in Lakshmi Chand vs Anandi, two brothers having no male issue and constituting a joint Hindu family governed by Mitakshara, signed a document, described therein as an agreement by way of will.
The document provided in effect that if either party died without male issue, his widow should take a life interest in a moiety of the whole estate and that if both the parties died without male issue, the daughters of each, or their male issue, should divide the father 's share.
The document was registered.
A few days after its execution one brother died, and his widow was entered as owner of a moiety of the estate.
Subsequently the other brother sued for a declaration that the document was null and void.
Privy Council held that the document could not operate as will but that as a co sharer in a Mitakshara joint family with the consent of all his co sharers he could deal with the share to which he would be entitled on a partition and was binding as family arrangement.
To be effective as a family arrangement the deed must be one intended to operate from the date of its execution, a feature wanting in Ext.
P 1, and it must be assented to and acquiesced in and acted upon by all affected thereby.
At the time of execution of Ext.
P 1 there is no evidence as to who were the adult members of the family other than Karappan who consented to the alleged family arrangement.
One thing, however, may be pointed out that defendant 1 gave his age as 87 years on December 29, 1959, when his evidence commenced.
Presumably he must have been born in 1872.
But there is no evidence about the age of other children of Karappan.
The only evidence as to the consent of the male members is that after the death of Karappan all male members acted according to the wishes of Karappan as disclosed and ordained in Ext.
Assuming it to be so, Ext.
P 1 was to operate after the death of Karappan and not from the date of execution.
The High Court after referring to Brijraj Singh 's case (supra) overlooked the fact that in accepting the deed before it, the Judicial Committee was impressed by the fact that it was intended to speak from the date on which it was written and not future date, viz., 1145 death of the writer.
P 1 in terms reserves to Karappan his right to deal with the property at his sweet will and was to be operative after his death.
The High Court completely overlooked this material difference.
Assuming that Ext.
P 1 was to be treated as family arrangement after the death of Karappan, the absence of any evidence of agreement amongst family members entitled to a share, to the terms of Ext.
P 1 when it was executed, the absence of any dispute at or about the time Ext.
P 1 was executed amongst the members of the family sought to be settled by Ext.
P 1; and the absence of evidence that arrangement was necessary for the security of the family or property would wholly negative the contention that Ext.
P 1 would furnish evidence of family arrangement.
We have grave doubt whether a Hindu father can impose family arrangement sans direct evidence of consent of each of his sons, to be effective after his death.
Therefore, Ext.
P 1 does not furnish evidence of family arrangement.
Now, if Ext.
P 1 cannot be effective as a deed of partition inasmuch as it did not result in division of property by metes and bounds, its effect on continued joint family status may be examined.
If it disrupted joint family status by its very execution, there was thereafter no question of directing any family arrangement to be effective from a future date as per its terms and even though it may spell out a family arrangement what effect the disruption of joint family status would have on the mode of succession has to be ascertained.
One thing is crystal clear that Ext.
P 1 is not a deed of partition in the sense it does not purport to divide the property amongst various coparceners by metes and bounds.
However, in Hindu law qua joint family and joint family property the word 'partition ' is understood in a special sense.
If severance of joint status is brought about by a deed, a writing or an unequivocal declaration of intention to bring about such disruption, qua the joint family, it constitutes partition.
(see Raghavamma vs Chenchamma).
To constitute a partition all that is necessary is a definite and unequivocal indication of intention by a member of a joint family to separate himself from the family.
What from such intimation, indication or representation of such interest should take would depend upon the circumstances of each case.
A further requirement is that this unequivocal indication of intention to separate must be to the knowledge of the persons affected by such declaration.
A review of the decisions shows that this intention to separate may be manifested in diverse ways.
It may be by notice or by filing a suit.
Undoubtedly, indication or 1146 intimation must be to members of the joint family likely to be affected by such a declaration.
Has not Ext.
P 1 the effect of bringing about a disruption of joint family headed by Karappan and consisting of himself and his sons? The fact situation is that in Ext.
P 1 Karappan specified the share of each of his sons, the property allotted on share being valued at Rs. 1300/ each of the four by the first wife and one by the second wife, and vesting the share so specified in each of his sons.
He also specified value of the property allotted to his first wife, to his second wife and to the second wife of his father.
In the process he found that something more was given to the sons of his first wife and in order to restore the equilibrium of treating his sons equally, he directed that owelty to the tune of Rs. 227/ and odd be paid by the sons of the first wife to the sons of his second wife.
This was with a view to correcting the inequality in division of shares.
He also states that there will be two branches.
He refers to them as tavazhies and himself and his family as tarvad.
Tarvad is akin to joint family and tavazhi is a branch of the family.
The High Court, however, treated the use of the words 'tarvad ' and 'tavazhi ' and 'Karnavaran ' to be inappropriate and hence inconsequential.
Similarly, the High Court found specification of share of each of the male child as not indicative of a partition in the sense of disruption of joint family status.
Partition can be partial qua person and property but a partition which follows disruption of a joint family status will be amongst those who are entitled to a share on partition.
On death of Karappan, Kesavan, the son of the second wife obtained a physical partition of the property, took his own share and left the family.
There was first a disruption of the joint family by specifying the shares in Ext.
Till disruption of joint family status takes place no coparcener can claim what is his exact share in coparcenary property.
It is liable to increase and decrease depending upon the addition to the number or departure of a male member and inheritance by survivor ship.
But once a disruption of joint family status takes place, coparceners cease to hold the property as joint tenants but they hold as tenants in common.
Looking to the terms of Ext.
P 1 there was a disruption of joint family status, the shares were specified and vested, liabilities and obligations towards the family members were defined and imbalance out of unequal division was corrected.
This certainly has effect of bringing about disruption of joint family status and even if there was no partition by metes and bounds and the coparceners continued to remain under the same roof or enjoyed the 1147 property without division by metes and bounds, they did not hold as joint tenants unless re union is pleaded and proved.
It was, however, contended and the contention has found favour with the High Court that when Kesavan, the second wife 's son of Karappan took the properties allotted to his share and left the family, as per terms of Ext.
P 1 four sons of Nani were constituted joint tenants or members of a coparcenary.
In reaching this conclusion reliance was placed by the High Court on Palani Ammal vs Muthuvenkatachala Moniagar.
In that case, after referring to Appovier 's case, (supra) it was observed as under: ""But the mere fact that the shares of the coparceners have been ascertained does not by itself necessarily lead to an inference that the family had separated.
There may be reasons other than a contemplated immediate separation for ascertaining what the shares of the coparceners on a separation would be.
It is also now beyond doubt that a member of such a joint family can separate himself from other members of the joint family and is on separation entitled to have his share in the property ascertained and partitioned off for him and that the remaining coparceners without any special agreement amongst themselves may continue to be coparceners and to enjoy as members of a joint family, what remained after such a partition of the family property.
That the remaining members continued to be joint may, if disputed, be inferred from the way in which their family business was carried on after their previous coparcener had separated from them."" In Bhagwan Dayal vs Smt.
Reoti Devi, this Court examined the effect of a separation of one member of a joint family on the joint family status and on the remaining members in the light of the Privy Council decision in Palani Ammal 's case.
(supra) The relevant observation is as under: ""The general principle is that every Hindu family is presumed to be joint unless the contrary is proved: but this presumption can be rebutted by direct evidence or by course of conduct.
It is also settled that there is no presumption that when one member separates from others that the latter remained united; whether the latter remain united or not must be decided on the facts of each case."" 1148 In fact, Judicial Committee in Balabux vs Rukhmabai unequivocally held that there is no presumption when one coparcener separates from others that the latter remained united.
An agreement amongst them must be proved either to remain united or to reunite.
In Sengoda vs Muthu, the High Court interpreted Palani Ammals case to lay down that if a partition takes place with respect to one coparcener, the decree or the deed bringing about partition would provide a pointer as to the effect of the decree or the deed on the remaining coparceners.
In Bhagwati Prasad Shah & Ors.
Dulhin Rameshwari Juer & Anr.
, this Court pointed out that the general principle undoubtedly is that a Hindu family is presumed to be joint unless the contrary is proved but where it is admitted that one of the coparceners did separate himself from the other members of the joint family and had his share in the joint property partitioned off for him, there is no presumption that the rest of the coparceners continued to be joint.
There is no presumption on the other side too that because one member of the family separated himself there has been separation with regard to all.
It would be a question of fact to be determined in each case upon the evidence relating to the intention of the parties whether there was a separation amongst the other coparceners or they remained united.
Except that four sons by Nani remained under one roof and were joint in food and laboured together there is no evidence that they agreed to constitute a coparcenary assuming that a coparcenary a creature of law could be created by agreement.
And if Karappan specified even the share of each of his sons by Nani in Ext.
P 1, this evidence of remaining together is hardly sufficient to warrant a conclusion that these four sons constituted a coparcenary.
P 1 could not support such a conclusion and High Court was in error in spelling out such conclusion from Ext.
P 1 overlooking its specific direction of a specified share of each of his sons and liability to pay owelty.
A further submission that there was partition branchwise is unknown to Mitakshara law and is wholly untenable.
In Mayne 's Hindu Law, 11th Edn., p. 347, law as thus stated: ""So long as a family remains an undivided family, two or more members of it, whether they be members of different branches or of one and the same branch of the family, can have no legal existence as a separate independent unit; but all the members of a branch, or of a sub branch, 1149 can form a distinct and separate corporate unit within the larger corporate family and hold property as such.
Such property will be joint family property of the members of the branch inter se, but will be separate property of that branch in relation to the larger family.
The principle of joint tenancy is unknown to Hindu law except in the case of the joint property of an undivided Hindu family governed by the Mitakshara law.
"" In Bhagwan Dayal 's case (supra) legal position after referring to earlier decisions has been culled out as under: ""Coparcenary is a creature of Hindu law and cannot be created by agreement of parties except in the case of re union.
It is a corporate body or a family unit.
The law also recognizes a branch of the family as a subordinate cooperate body.
The said family unit, whether the larger one or the subordinate one, can acquire, hold and dispose of family property subject to the limitations laid down by law.
Hindu law does not recognise some of the members of a joint family belonging to different branches, or even to a single branch, as a corporate unit.
"" Now, if five sons of Karappan each constituted a branch, obviously after one son as a branch separated unless a reunion is pleaded, other four cannot constitute a corporate body like a coparcenary by agreement or even by subsequent conduct of remaining together enjoying the property together.
In Balkishen Das & Ors.
vs Ram Narain Sahu & Ors., an ikrarnama was produced which showed that defined shares in the whole estate had been allotted to the several coparceners.
There was a passage which gave liberty to any of the parties either to live together as a member of the joint family or to separate his own business.
Mahabir was given four annas share and others defined shares in the remainder.
Contention raised was that Mahabir alone separated and others remained joint.
Subsequent conduct was relied upon to substantiate the contention that they remained together.
Negativing this contention it was held that the ikrarnama effected a separation of estate even if the parties elected either to have a partition of their shares by metes and bounds, or to continue to live together and enjoy their property in common as before.
Whether they did one or the other would affect the mode of enjoyment, but not the tenure of the property or their interest in it.
The ikrarnama effected a separation in estate, its legal 1150 construction and effect could not be controlled or altered by the subsequent conduct.
Once the shares were determined and allotted, it was held consistently with Appovier 's case (supra) that this converted them from joint holders into tenants in common.
In Boddu Venkatakrishna Rao & Ors.
vs Boddu Satyavathi & Ors., the following passage in Mulla 's Transfer of Property Act (Fifth Edn.), was approved: ""The principle of joint tenancy appears to be unknown to Hindu law, except in the case of coparcenary between the members of an undivided family.
"" Once disruption of joint family status takes place as Lord Westbury puts it in Appovier 's case, (supra) it covers both a division of right and division of property.
If a document clearly shows the division of rights and status its legal construction and effect cannot be altered by evidence of subsequent conduct of parties.
Now, in this case Ext.
P 1 itself specifies the share of each member separately.
There is no concept known to Hindu law that there could be a branch of a family wife wise.
To illustrate, if a Hindu father has two wives and he has three male children by the first wife and two by the second, each wife constituting a branch with her children of the family is a concept foreign to Hindu law.
Therefore, tavazhi wife wise stated in Ext.
P 1 has to be ignored and the contention that there was a partition amongst wife wise branches as represented by each wife is equally untenable.
P 1 did bring about a specification of shares and once such shares were defined by the father who had the power to define and vesting the same there was a disruption of joint family.
There was thus a division of rights and division of property by allotment of shares.
The mode of enjoyment immediately changed and members of such family ceased to be coparceners holding as joint tenants but they held as tenants in common.
Subsequent conduct of some of them to stay together in the absence of any evidence of re union as understood in law is of no consequence.
In any event when Kesavan, the son of the second wife, sought and obtained physical partition of the properties allotted to him and left the family there being no evidence whether others agreed to remain united except the so called evidence of subsequent conduct, which is irrelevant or of no consequence, disruption of status was complete.
Therefore, the four sons of the first wife held the property as tenants in common.
There is evidence in the form of some documents showing that defendant 1 was described as Karnavaran of a coparcenary of the 1151 four sons of the first wife of Karappan and that the property was enjoyed as a joint family property.
In view of our conclusion that such subsequent conduct is not conclusive of any agreement to reunite, it is not necessary to examine the evidence.
In view of our conclusion that since the execution of Ext.
P 1 on January 25, 1910, or after the death of Karappan in February 1910, when Kesavan, the son of the second wife took his share of the property left the family there was a disruption of the joint family and the sons of Karappan by his first wife held the property, which remained for them after Kesavan obtained his share, not as joint tenants but as tenants in common, the plaintiff would be entitled to the share to which her deceased husband Raman was entitled.
Raman had 1/4 share in A schedule properties which the plaintiff would be entitled and therefore, there would be a preliminary decree in her favour to that effect.
Plaintiff 's claim to a share in properties set out in schedules B and C annexed to the plaint has been concurrently negatived by both the courts on the finding that they are the properties of defendant 1 and his wife and are not accretions to the property which devolved from Karappan.
This concurrent finding of fact arrived at on appreciation of evidence appears to be correct and need not be disturbed.
Therefore, plaintiff 's suit with regard to a share in B and C schedule properties has been rightly dismissed.
At the commencement of hearing of the appeal it was pointed out that original plaintiff Kallyani is dead and there is some dispute between her two daughters Yashoda and Janaki about succession to the estate of Kallyani.
Both had applied to the exclusion of each other for being substituted as legal representatives of the deceased.
For purposes of this appeal both were substituted for the deceased appellant.
It is not necessary to decide this question in this appeal because whoever of the two establishes her right to inherit the property of Kallyani would be entitled to the same but the dispute would be between Yashoda and Janaki and the other defendants have no right to be heard in that matter.
Accordingly this appeal succeeds and it is partly allowed.
The judgment and decree of the trial Court and the High Court dismissing the plaintiff 's suit in regard to A schedule property are set aside.
Plaintiff 's suit is decreed and it is declared that she has 1/4 share in properties set out in schedule A annexed to the plaint.
A preliminary decree to that effect shall be drawn.
Defendant 1 shall pay the costs of the plaintiff throughout.
S.R. Appeal allowed in part.
","One Karappan son of Chulliparambil Krishnan had two wives Naini and Ponni.
Through his first wife Naini he had four sons Krishnan (D1), Shankaran (D2), Raman and the husband of plaintiff appellant Kallyani who died after him and Madhavan who predeceased him and husband of D3 and father of D4, D5 and D6 and four daughters.
He had one son by name Kesavan and two daughters, through his second wife Ponni.
One Valli was the second wife of his father and she had three daughters.
Karappan and his family are Ezhavas and in the matter of inheritance, succession and on the question of personal law they were governed essentially by customary law and in the absence of any specific custom, they are governed by the Hindu Mitakshara law.
Karappan executed a registered deed variously described as a will or a deed of partition or evidencing family arrangement, exhibit P1 dated January 25, 1910.
In this deed after narrating his near relations including his two wives male and female children born to each and his father 's second wife and her children, he described the manner in which the A, B and C scheduled properties should be taken by them, after his death.
In February 1910 Karappan died.
Raman, the husband of the plaintiff appellant, the third son of the first wife died on February 20, 1936.
Plaintiff widow of Raman sued for partition and separate possession of her undivided 1/4 share in properties set out in A, B and C schedules to the plaint.
The Trial Court held that Ext.
P1 had the effect of constituting a coparcenary of four brothers, sons of first wife of Karappan and that it was their joint family property and they did not hold as tenants in common but as joint tenants and were governed by survivorship in the matter of succession.
The contention that even in such a situation the widow would be entitled to her husband 's share because of a customary right was negatived.
In respect of B & C schedule properties, it was held that they belonged exclusively to defendant 1 and his wife and plaintiff cannot claim a share in them.
The High Court affirmed the Trial Court 's judgment and decree treating exhibit P1 as family arrangement and hence the plaintiff 's appeal by certificate.
Allowing the appeal, the Court ^ HELD: 1. Ext.
P1, styled as a will by the deceased Karappan is not effective as a will.
If by Ext.
P 1 deceased Karappan attempted to make a will of the ancestral property in his hand in which his sons had acquired 1131 interest by birth, obviously he had no power to make a will in respect of such property.
exhibit P1 does not purport to devise by will the undivided share of testator Karappan in the joint family property, but he attempts to dispose of by a will all the properties in which his sons had interest by birth.
He had not claimed any share in the property but claimed a right to deal with ancestral property as he desired.
In exhibit P1 itself he describes properties set out in schedules A and B annexed to exhibit P1 as his tarvad properties.
[1139B C] 2.
Expression ""tarvad"" in Marumakkattayam law is the name given to the joint family consisting of males and females, all descendants in the female line from a common ancestress.
A tarvad may consist of two or more branches known as 'Thavazhies ', each tavazhi or branch consisting of one of the female members of the tarvad and her descendants in the female line.
Thus when property is described as tarvad property in a broad sense it is admitted to be joint family.
This also becomes clear from the recital in exhibit P.1 that properties set out in A and B schedules were tarvad properties and property in C schedule were claimed by him as his self acquired properties and they were to be kept joint and were not sought to be dealt with by exhibit P1.
Therefore, to the extent exhibit P1 purports to dispose of an ancestral properties by will it would be ineffective as a will as Karappan had no power or authority to dispose of by will ancestral properties in his hand.
[1139C G] 3.
Partition is a word of technical import in Hindu law.
Partition in one sense is a severance of joint family status and coparcener of a coparcenary is entitled to claim it as a matter of his individual volition.
In this narrow sense all that is necessary to constitute partition is a definite and unequivocal indication of his intention by a member of a joint family to separate himself from the family and enjoy his share in severalty.
Such an unequivocal intention to separate brings about a disruption of joint family status, at any rate, in respect of separating member or members and thereby puts an end to the coparcenary with right of survivorship and such separated member holds from the time of disruption of joint family as tenant in common.
Such partition has an impact on devolution of shares of such members.
It goes to his heirs displacing survivorship.
Such partition irrespective of whether it is accompanied or followed by division of properties by metes and bounds covers both a division of right and division of property.
A disruption of joint family status by definite and unequivocal indication to separate implies separation in interest and in right, although not immediately followed by a de facto actual division of the subject matter.
This may at any time, be claimed by virtue of the separate right.
A physical and actual division of property by metes and bounds follows from disruption of status and would be termed partition in a broader sense.
[1140A E] 4.
A Hindu father joint with his sons governed by Mitakshara law has the power to partition the joint family property at any moment during his life time.
The consent of the sons is not necessary for the exercise of that power.
This power comprehends the power to disrupt joint family status.
[1141H, 1142A] Kandaswamy vs Doraiswamy Iyer, Mad. 317; approved.
Even though the father has a right to make a partition of the joint family property in his hand, he has no right to make a partition by will of joint family property amongst various members of the family except, of course, with their consent.
In the instant case, if by exhibit P1 Karappan attempted to make 1132 a partition of the property by his will, exhibit P1 would be ineffective as a partition.
By exhibit P1 Karappan does not divide his property by metes and bounds vesting the share of each in present in each of his sons.
[1142B C] exhibit P1 would not be effective as a partition in broader sense, namely, dividing property by metes and bounds from the date on which it was executed as it was to be effective from a future date and that future uncertain even was the death of Karappan and that during the time he would remain alive he would deal with the properties at his sweet will.
Further, there was no effective partition by metes and bounds by exhibit P1 though the shares of sons were specified as also the provision for female members was made.
If intention of the testator is to be gathered from the language of exhibit P1 Karappan intended it to be a will not a partition in presenti.
Therefore, exhibit P1 cannot be effective as a deed of partition in the broader sense i.e., partition by metes and bounds.
[1142E G] Brijraj Singh vs Sheodan Singh, 10 I.A. 161; referred.
An ineffective will sometimes though not always, if otherwise consented by all adult members, may be effective as a family arrangement but as the father of a joint Hindu family has no power to impose a family arrangement under the guise of exercising the power of partition, the power which undoubtedly he had but which he has failed to effectively exercise, it cannot in the absence of consent of all male members bind them as a family arrangement.
[1143D F] 7.
A family management must be an agreement amongst the various members of the family intended to be generally and reasonably for the benefit of the family and secondly the agreement should be with the object either of compromising doubtful or disputed rights or for preserving the family property or the place and security of the family.
In this case, both these ingredients are absent.
[1143F G] H. N. Aryamurthy & Anr.
vs N. D. Subbaraya Setty (dead) through I.rs and Ors., ; applied.
Brijraj Singh vs Sheodan Singh, 40 I.A. 161; Lakshmichand vs Anandi, 53 I.A. 123; discussed.
To be effective as a family arrangement the deed must be one intended to operate from the date of the execution, and it must be assented to and acquiesced in and acted upon by all affected party.
In the instant case, exhibit P1 in term reserves to Karappan his right to deal with the property at his sweet will and was to be operative after his death.
Moreover, at the time of the execution of exhibit P.1 there is no evidence as to who were the adult members of the family other than Karappan who consented to the alleged family arrangement.
Assuming that exhibit P1 was to be treated as family arrangement after the death of Karappan, the absence of any evidence of agreement amongst family members entitled to share, to the terms of exhibit P.1 when it was executed, the absence of any dispute at or about the time exhibit P.1 was executed amongst the members of the family sought to be settled by exhibit P.1 and the absence of evidence that arrangement was necessary for the security of the family or property would wholly negative the contention that exhibit P.1 would furnish evidence of family arrangement.
It is doubtful whether a Hindu father can 1133 impose family arrangement sans direct evidence of consent of each of his sons, to be effective after his death.
Therefore exhibit P 1 does not furnish evidence of family arrangement.
[1444E H, 1145A C] 9.
In Hindu Law qua joint family and joint family property the word partition ' is understood in a special sense.
If severance of joint family status is brought about by a deed, a writing or an unequivocal declaration of intention to bring about such disruption, qua the joint family, it constitutes partition.
To constitute a partition all that is necessary is a definite and unequivocal indication of intention by a member of a joint family to separate himself from the family What form such intimation, indication or representation of members should take would depend upon the circumstances of each case.
A further requirement is that the unequivocal indication of intention to separate must be to the knowledge of the persons affected by such declaration: This intention to separate may be manifest in diverse ways.
Undoubtedly, indication or intimation must be to members of the joint family likely to be affected by such a declaration.
[1145E H, 1146A] Raghavan vs Chenchamma, ; ; referred to.
Partition can be partial qua person and property but a partition which follows disruption of joint family status will be amongst those who are entitled to a share on partition.
Till disruption of joint family status takes place no coparcener can claim what is his exact share in coparcenary property.
It is liable to increase and decrease depending upon the addition to the number or departure of a male member and inheritance by survivorship.
But once a disruption of joint family status takes place, coparceners cease to hold the property as joint tenants but they hold as tenants in common.
[1146E G] In the instant case, on death of Karappan, Kesavan the son of the second wife obtained a physical partition of the property took his owon share and left the family, there was first a disruption of the joint family status.
Looking to the terms of exhibit P 1 there was a disruption of joint family status as the share of each son was specified and vested, liabilities and obligations towards the family members were defined and imbalance out of unequal division was corrected.
This certainly has the effect of bringing about disruption of joint family status and even if there was no partition by metes and bounds and the coparceners continued to remain under the same roof or enjoyed the property without division by metes and bounds, they did not hold as joint tenants unless re union is pleaded and proved.
[1146G H, 1147A] 11.
There is no presumption when one coparcener separates from other that the latter remained united.
An agreement amongst them must be proved either to remain united or to re unite.
A Hindu family is presumed to be joint unless the contrary is proved but where it is admitted that one of the coparceners did separate himself from the other members of the joint family and had his share in the joint property partitioned off for him, there is no presumption that the rest of the coparceners continued to be joint.
There is no presumption on the other side too that because one member of the family separated himself there has been separation with regard to all.
It would be a question of fact to be determined in each case upon the evidence relating to the intention of the parties whether there was a separation amongst the other coparceners or they remained united.
Except that four sons by Naini remained 1134 under one roof and were joint in food laboured together there is no evidence that they agreed to constitute a coparcenary assuming that a coparcenary a creature of law could be created by agreement.
And if Karappan specified even the share of each of his sons by Naini in exhibit P 1, this evidence of remaining together is hardly sufficient to warrant a conclusion that these four sons constituted a coparcenary.
exhibit P 1, could not support such a conclusion and the High Court was in error in spelling out such conclusion from exhibit P 1 overlooking its specific direction of a specified share of each of his sons and liability to pay owelty.

Partition branchwise is unknown to Mitakshara Law.
In the instant case, if five sons of Karappan each constituted a branch obviously after one son as a branch separated unless a reunion is pleaded, other four cannot constitute a corporate body like a coparcenary by agreement or even by subsequent conduct of remaining together enjoying the property together.

Once disruption of joint family status takes place, it covers both a division of right and division of property.
If a document clearly shows the division of rights and status its legal construction and effect cannot be altered by evidence of subsequent conduct of parties.

There is no concept known to Hindu Law that there would be a branch of a family wife wise.
[1150D] In this case exhibit P 1 itself specifies the share of each member separately.
Therefore, tavazhi wife wise stated in exhibit P 1 has to be ignored.
Ex P 1 did bring about a specification of shares and once such shares were defined by the father who had the power to define and vesting the same there was a disruption of joint family.
There was thus a division of rights and division of property by allotment of shares.
The mode of enjoyment immediately changed and members of such family ceased to be coparceners holding as joint tenants but they held as tenants in common.
The plaintiff would be entitled to the share to which her deceased husband Raman was entitled.
Raman had 1/4th share in 'A ' schedule properties which the plaintiff would be entitled.
[1150D, E F, 1151C]
</s>","  The High Court held that the properties were to be divided among the heirs of the deceased Karappan as per the Mitakshara Law and not as per customary law.
It further held that the use of the word 'tavazhi'in describing the two units in the will was sufficient to establish an intention that the members of each unit were to take the property as coparceners and not as tenants in common.
Hence, the two questions referred to the Supreme Court.
The first question is whether under the Mitakshara Law the parties are governed by customary law and, in the absence of any rule of customary law on the point in question, by Mitakshara Law property can be divided between two artificial units of a joint family, one comprising the sons of a father by his first wife, the first wife and his step mother, and the other comprising his son by his second wife and the second wife so as to constitute each unit into a coparcenary with rights of survivorship between its members.
The second question is whether the use of the word 'tavazhi'(in any case a misnomer) in describing the two units in the will, Ext.
P 1 left by the father and held to be the basis of the family settlement, is sufficient in the circumstances to establish an intention that the members of each unit were to take the property as coparceners and not as tenants in common, the grouping into units being only for convenient enjoyment? The facts leading to the reference of these questions are as follows.
One Karappan, son of Chulliparambil Krishnan, had two wives Nani and Ponni.
Defendant 1 Krishnan, defendant 2 Shankaran, one Raman, husband of plaintiff Kallyani, and deceased Madhavan, husband of defendant 3 and father of defendants 4, 5 and 6, were his sons by first wife Nani, and one Kesavan was his son by the second wife Ponni.
He had six daughters, four by the first wife and two by the second wife.
One Valli was the second wife of his father and she had three daughters.
Karappan and his family are Ezhavas and in the matter of inheritance, succession and on the question of personal law they were governed essentially by customary law and in the absence of any specific custom they are governed by the Hindu Mitakshara Law.
Karappan executed a registered deed variously described as a will or a deed of partition or evidencing family arrangement, Ext.
P 1 dated January 25, 1910, the salient features of which may be reproduced.
After narrating his near relations including his two wives, male and female children born to each and his father's second wife and her children, the following recitals are worthy of note: ""There are as belonging to me now properties to the value of Rs. 8000/ mentioned in the subjoined schedules A and B as my tarwad properties and also my self acquired properties and properties to the value of Rs. 200/ of the C schedule which is set apart as common properties"".
""Since I am seriously ill and in order that there may not arise any dispute in future in respect of properties belonging to me, I have resolved today the following with regard to the course of enjoyment of the said properties after my death"".
""I myself shall have the full powers of disposition over all the properties described in A, B and C schedules during my life time and after my death, out of the properties to the value of Rs. 8000/, Rs. 1300/ worth of properties shall vest in each of my male issues, Rs. 300/ in my first wife, Rs. 1000/ in my second wife since she is sick and Rs. 200/ in my 1137 "

G. section Pathak and Naunit Lal, for the appellants.
A. V. Viswanatha Sastri, section N. Andley, Rameshwar Nath and P. L. Vohra, for the respondent.
October 13.
The Judgment of the Court was delivered by GAJENDRAGADKAR, J.
This appeal by a certificate granted by the Calcutta High Court arises out of a suit filed by the three appellants against the respondent to recover Rs. 83,640/ .
The three appellants are respectively the Firm Radhakrishan Shivdutt Rai which carries on business at Banaras and RamKumar Lal for himself and as karta of his joint family as well as Madan Gopal for himself and as karta of his joint family, the latter two being 83 the partners in the first mentioned Firm Radhakrishna Sivadutta Rai; for convenience we will refer to the partnership firm hereafter as the appellant.
The respondent Tayeballi Dawoodbhai is a partnership firm which carries on business at Calcutta.
The appellant 's case was that the appellant and the respondent had entered into a contract in the first instance on December 18, 1980, through brokers named T. N. Mehrotra & co.
,Calcutta.
This contract was later confirmed by two letters written respectively on January 3 and 15, 1951, by the appellant to the respondent and replied to by the. respondent.
By this contract the respondent agreed to sell 1000 bales of Banaras Hemp particulars of which were set out in the plaint.
According to the appellant, by a letter written on March 14, 1951, the appellant in part performance of the said contract accepted delivery of 110 bales of Banaras Hemp No. 1 and 50 bales of Banaras Hemp No. 2; this delivery was Made by the respondent to L. N. Poddar & Co., who acted as the agent of the appellant and Paid the price of the said 160 bales.
In they transaction the respondent realised Rs. 3,840 from the said I,.
N. Poddar &; Co. in excess of the actual price of the goods delivered to the said company.
Inspite of the repeated demands made by the appellant the respondent failed to deliver the balance of the goods contracted for and thus committed breach of the contract.
That is how the appellant claimed Rs.(9,80(j as difference between the market rate on March 31, 1951, and the contract rate of the balance deliverable under the contract in suit.
This amount was claimed as damages for the breach of contract.
In addition an amount of Rs. 3,840 was claimed as having been paid in excess of tho value of 160 bales delivered to L. N. Poddar & Co., on behalf of the appellant.
This claim was resisted by the respondent on several grounds.
The principal contention urged by the respondent, however, was that in relation to 84 the contract in suit the appellant had acted as agent for its disclosed principal Messrs Khaitan and Sons Ltd., and as such it was not entitled to bring the present suit.
The respondent further alleged that the said disclosed principal Messrs. Khaitan and J. Sons had settled all their rights and loams under the suit contract with their agent and so the present claim for damages was not maintainable.
In regard to the claim for Rs. 3,840 tho respondent pleaded that the appellant 's case was untrue.
Several other pleas were also raised but with the said pleas we are not concerned in the present appeal.
Mr. Justice Bose who tried the suit framed twelve issues.
On the principal point in controversy between the parties the learned judge found that the appellant had entered into the contract with the respondent on its own account and not on account of the disclosed principal as alleged by the respondent.
According to the learned judge the reference to Messrs. Khaitan and Sons Ltd., made in the bought and sold notes on which the respondent 's plea was based had been inserted by the brokers ""by mistake or due to some misconception.
"" The learned judge also found that the respondent had committed a breach of the contract as alleged by the appellant.
The appellant 's case with regard to the excess payment of Rs. 3,840 made by L. N. Poddar & co. was, however, held not to have been proved.
In the result a decree was passed in favour of the appellant for Rs. 79,800 along with interest as stipulated in the decree.
Against this decree the respondent preferred an appeal; and the main point which was urged on its behalf was directed against the finding of the trial judge that the contract had been entered into by the appellant for itself and not on account of the disclosed principal.
This contention was based in the Court of Appeal, as in the trial court, on the bought and sold notes; and it was urged that 85 the bought and sold notes clearly showed that the appellant had entered into the contract on account of the disclosed principal Messrs. Khaitan and Sons Ltd.
Before the Appellate Court the respondent 's case was that the said bought and sold notes constituted the terms.
Of the contract and no other evidence was relevant and admissible in order to determine the said terms.
Das Gupta, J., upheld this.
In his opinion the bought and sold notes issued by the brokers Constituted the sole basis for the terms.
Of the contract and the two letters subsequently written on January 3 and 15, 1951, were inadmissible and irrelevant for the purpose of determining the said terms of the contract.
Tho learned judge, however, considered tho matter also on the alternative basis.
that the said letters could be considered for ascertaining the terms.
Of the contract and came to the conclusion that can reading the said letters and the bought and sold notes together the result was the same, namely, that the contract had been entered into by the appellant on behalf of the disclosed principal.
Bachawat, J., differed from Das Gupta, J., on the question about the relevance and admissibility of the two subsequent letters.
According to him the two bought and sold notes.
and the two letters between them constituted the terms of the contract.
He was inclined to take the view that the letters could not be regarded as inadmissible or irrelevant.
Reading the four documents together the learned judge.
however, agreed with the conclusion alternatively recorded by Das Gupta, J., and held that the four documents supported the respondent 's plea that the appellant had entered into the contract on behalf of the disclosed principal.
Both the learned judges agreed in holding that there was no evidence to support the appellants plea that the reference to the principal made in the bought and sold notes was a result of any mistake.
On these findings the decree passed by the trial court was reversed and the appellant 's suit Was ordered to be dismissed.
86 In regard to the costs, however, the Appellante Could took the view that the point raised before the Appellate Court about the effect of the bought and field notes had not been specifically mooted before the trial court and that several other pleas raised by the respondent were found by the trial court to be false and so the proper older as to costs would be that each party should bear its costs throughout.
After this judgement was delivered the appellant applied for and obtained a certificate from the High Court and it is with the said certificate that the present appeal has been brought before this Court.
On its behalf Mr. Pathak has strenuously contended that the Appellate Court was in error in coming to the conclusion that the contracts in suit had been entered into by the appellant on behalf of the disclosed principal Messrs. Khaitan & Sons Ltd., Banaras.
For the purpose of deciding this point we propose to assume in favour of the appellant that the terms of the contract may be gathered from the two bought and sold notes on which the respondent relies as well as the two subsequent letters on which the appellant relies.
It would be convenient at this stage to set out the said documents.
We will first refer to the brokers ' notes and the confirmation slips in respect thereon.
This is how the brokers ' notes read: ""T. N. Mehrotra and Co. No. 377 Hemp, Oil and Oil Seedh Pollock House Brokers.

Copy to Messrs. T. N. Mehrotra & Co., Calcutta, and to Gopinath Mehrotra, Banaras."" Mr. Pathak contends that in construing the effect of the relevant documents we should not 90 attach any importance to the reference to Khaitan & Sons made in the bought and sold notes for the simple reason that the said reference is the result of a mistake or misconception on the part of the brokers.
In that connection he contended that the J. finding recorded by the trial court on the issue of mistake should be accepted by us and not the finding made by the/ Appellate court.
We are not impressed by this argument.
In regard to these notes we have the evidence of Trilokinath and Gopinath on behalf of the brokers which negatives the theory of mistake or misconception.
Trilokinath has stated on oath that when he got the offer from the respondent he telephoned to his brother Gopinath who is a broker in respect of hemp of the firm of Sewnath Gopinath and he told him about the offer.
Gopinath then informed Trilokinath that the offer was closed either on the 16th or on the morning of the 17th.
This information was received by Trilokinath from Gopinath on the telephone.
Trilokinath was then asked about the information that his brother gave him, and he stated that his brother told him that the offer which he had communicated to him in respect of 1000 bales at Rs. 165 and.
Rs. 145 had been sold by him to Khaitan Sons & Co., Fibre Ltd. He also added that he received another message from his brother either on the 18th or on the night of the 17th to prepare a contract so that it will be Khaitan & Sons through the appellant; Thus, it is clear that the evidence of Trilokinath, if believed, clearly shows that there could be no mistake or misappreciation on the part of the brokers, when the notes referred to Khaitan & Sons as principal in respect of the transaction.
Gopinath substantially corroborated the evidence given by Trilokinath.
He stated that when he got the offer from his brother Trilokinath he went to Deokinandan who was working for Khaitan & Sons and it was after discussion with Deokinandan thatthe souda was closed as one on behalf of Khaitan & Sons.
Having thus closed this 91 contract with Deokinandan, who represented the principal Khaitan & Sons, Gopinath told Trilokinath to close the offer and asked him to prepare the note showing that the appellant was acting as agent for the disclosed principal Khaitan & Sons.
Reading the evidence of the two brothers who worked as brokers in respect of the transaction in suit it is clear that any possibility of a mistake or misappreciation is wholly excluded.
On behalf of the appellant Gopal Lal Gupta has given evidence.
He attempted to explain away the fact that he did not protest against, or object to, the insertion of the name of Khaitan & Sons in the notes by suggesting that when he signed the confirmation slips after receiving the notes he had not noticed the reference to Khaitan & Sons.
His case was that the purchase had been made by the appellant for itself and not for any other firm, and the suggestion he made was that if he had noticed that the notes had made reference to Khaitan & Sons he would either have insisted upon the said name being delete(l or would not have concluded the contract; but when his statement that he did not notice the reference to Khaitan & Sons was tested in cross examination Gopal Lal was shaken, and he had to admit that when he signed the confirmation slip he may have noticed the reference to Khaitan & Sons but he did not read the document attentively.
He was, however, forced to concede that he had gone through the note before he signed the confirmation slip.
It was under stress of cross examination that Gopal Lal incidentally mentioned that the reference to Khaitan & Sons may have been made by mistake.
It is obvious that Gopal Lal 's evidence which otherwiee suffers from the infirmity that it is full of contradictions cannot be accepted on the question of mistake because his explanation about his conduct in signing the confirmation slips considered by itself is wholly unsatisfactory.
Therefore, in our opinion, the Appellate Court was fully justified in 92 reversing the finding of the trial court on this point and in coming to the conclusion that the reference to Khaitan & Sons which the notes made was no the result of any mistake or misconception In this connection it may be relevant to refer to the attitude adopted by the appellant when the dispute arising between the parties in the present contract had gone before the Bengal Chamber of Commerce for adjudication.
In those proceedings the respondent had raised the same plea that it has raised in the present suit.
It was urged on its behalf that the appellant was not entitled to make ally claim on the contract because it had entered into the contract on behalf of a disclosed principal and on its account.
Apparently that plea appears to have been accepted and the arbitration proceedings therefore ended as being without jurisdiction.
In meeting the plea raised by the respondent it is significant that the appellant thought it fit to urge that the respondent 's allegation that the appellant was the agent of one Khaitan & Co. was not correct and that there is no firm or company known as Khaitan & Co. Or Khaitan & Sons, Ltd., or Khaitan & Sons in Shewpur, Banaras.
The appellant therefore pleaded that the jurisdiction of the Chamber to entertain the case could not be disputed on that score.
The appellant also alleged that the reference to Khaitan &; Sons was superfluous and no importance should be attached to the said words.
In the suit itself a faint attempt was no doubt made to challenge the identity of the firm Khaitan Sc Sons, but Mr. Pathak has very fairly not attempted to raise that point before us.
It would thus be noticed that the principal point made by the appellant in the arbitration proceedings before the Chamber in respect of the reference to Khaitan & Sons in the notes was entirely frivolous; no case of mistake appears to have been set out at that state.
Besides, as we have already pointed out, there is no evidence on which a finding of mistake can be reasonably made in favour of the appellant.
Therefore, we 93 must proceed to consider the question about the construction of the relevant documents on the basis that the reference to Khaitan & Sons which the notes make is not the result of any mistake and has been made in the ordinary course of businesss by the brokers.
Let us then consider what the effect of the bought and sold notes is according to the established custom in the mercantile world.
Mr. Viswanatha Sastri, for the respondent, contends that, according to the established commercial usage, if there is no variation or disparity in the bought and sold notes, the bought and sold notes issued by the brokers constitute the terms of the contract between the parties for whom the brokers act.
We are inclined to accept this contention.
The effect of such notes issued by the brokers has been frequently considered by judicial decisions.
As early as 1846 the Privy council had occasion to deal with this question in Cowie vs Remfry (1).
In that case a. C & Co and H.& Co; were merchants at Calcutta.
The latter sold to the former a large quantity of indigo through the medium of a broker who drew up a sold note addressed to H.& Co. and submitted.
it to H. for his approval.
H. Objected to a particular word appearing in the note whereupon the broker took the sold note to C. and informed him of His objection.
C. then struck his pen through the word objected to by H. placed his initials over the erasure and returned the note to the broker.
The broker then delivered it in that altered form to H. & Co. Next day the broker delivered to C. & Co. a bought note which differed in certain material terms from the sold note.
In an action brought by H. & Co. against C. & Co. for the breach of the contract as contained in the sold note the Supreme Court at Calcutta was of the opinion that the sold note alone formed the contract and so it decreed the plaintiff 's suit.
On appeal by the defendant the Privy Council reversed (1) (1846) 3 M.I.A.448 94 the finding of the Supreme Court and held that the transaction was one of bought and sold notes and Rai held that the circumstances attending C. 's alteration of the sold note and affixing his initials were not sufficient to make that note alone a binding contract.
According to the Privy Council, there being a material variation in the terms of the bought with the sold note they together did not constitute a binding contract.
It would thus be seen that the Judicial Committee was dealing with a case where the bought and sold notes did not tally and so the decision was that where the bought and sold notes do not tally the sold note alone cannot constitute the terms of the contract.
In dealing with this question, however, their Lordships referred to the mercantile custom in regard to the bought and sold notes and observed that ""the established usage of dealing in the mercantile world should be held in high respect; the very existence of such usage shows that in practice it has been found useful and beneficial; the presumption is in its favour, and no departure from it is to be inferred from doubtful circumstances"".
That is why the Privy Council reached the conclusion that ""this must be considered as a transaction in the contemplation of the parties by bought and sold notes, and that, the contract is contained in both of the notes, and not in one;"" inevitably there being a material variation between the two notes ""the consequence follows, from all legal principles, that no binding contract has been effected"".
This decision shows that the mercantile usage of entering into contracts evidenced by the bought and sold notes issued by the brokers was treated by the Privy Council as well recognised.
The next decision to which reference may be usefully made is the case of Sievewright vs Archibald(l).
In that case again there was a variation in the bought and sold notes and the variation was material, and so it was held that there was no (1) ; , 1228, 1229.
95 sufficient memorandum of a contract to satisfy the Statute of Frauds.
In dealing with the question raised for the decision of the Court Lord Campbell, C. J., has made certain general observations which throw considerable light on the genesis of the bought and sold notes and the effect which is ually attributed to the said notes by commercial usage.
""If the bought note case be considered a memorandum of the parol agreement"", observed Lord Campbell, C. J., ""so may the sold note; and which of them is to prevail ? It seems to me, therefore, that we get back to the same point at which we were when the variance was first objected, and the declaration was amended.
I by no means say that where there are bought and sold notes they must necessarily be the only evidence of the contract; circumstances may be imagined in which they might be used as a memorandum of a parol agreement.
Where there has been an entry of the contract by the broker in his book signed by him, I should hold without hesitation, notwithstanding some dicta, and a supposed ruling of Lord Tenterden in Thornton vs Meux (M. & M. 43), to the contrary, that this entry is the binding contract between tho parties and that a mistake made by him, when sending them a copy of it in the shape of a bought or sold note, would not affect its validity.
Being authorised by the one to sel], and the other to buy, in the terms of the contract, when he has reduced it into writing and signed it as their common agent, it binds them both, according to the Statute of Frauds, as if both had signed it with their own hands; the duty of the broker requires him to do so; and till recent times, this duty was scrupulously performed by every broker.
What are called the bought and sold notes were sent by him to his principals by way of information that he had acted upon their instructions, but not as the actual contract which was to be binding upon them.
This; clearly appears from the practice still followed of sending the bought note to the buyer, and the sold 96 note to the seller; whereas, if these notes had been meant to constitute the contract, the bought note would be put into the hands of the seller, and the sold note into the hands of the buyer, that each might have the engagement of the other party J, and not his own.
But the broker, to save himself trouble, now omits to enter and sign any contract in his book, and still sends the bought and sold notes as before.
If these agree, they are held the constitute a binding contrat; if there be any material variance between them, they are both nullities, and there is no binding contract.
This last proposition, though combated by the plaintiff 's counsel, has been laid down and acted upon in such a long series of oases that I could not venture to contravene it, if I did not assent to it; but, where there is no evidence of the contract unless by the bought and sold notes sent by the broker to the parties, I do not see how there can be a binding contract unless they substantially agree; for contracting parties must consent to the same terms; and where the terms in the two notes differ there can be no reason why faith should be given to the one more than the other"".
These observations seem to establish two propositions, first that if the bought and sold notes show a material variation neither of them nor both of them taken together can be re.
lied upon for the purpose of proving the terms of the contract, and second if the bought and sold notes agree they are held to constitute a binding contract.
To the same effect is the observation made by the Privy Council in Ah Shain Shoke vs Moothia Chetty,(l) when Sir Richard Couch observed that ""Moothia Chetty, one of the respondents, said in his evidence he did not consider the contract as concluded until bought and sold notes were signed.
He was right in this.
They were the only evidence of the contract.
"" It is in the light of this legal position that we must consider the effect of the bought and sold (1) (1899) L. R. 27 I.A. 30 97 notes in the present case.
The notes referred to the appellant and added ""A/C Khaitan & Sons Ltd."" There is no disparity in the notes at all; and so the two notes can be safely taken to evidence the terms of the contract.
When along with the name of the appellant the notes specifically refer to a ""Khaitan & Sons Ltd."" with the preceding words ""A/c ' ', there can be no doubt that the appellant is shown by the notes to be acting on account of the disclosed principal.
The appellant realised that the effect of the reference to Khaitan & Sons in the notes would inevitably be to support the plea of the respondent that it was not entitled to bring the present action and so it pleaded that the said reference was the result of a mistake.
Therefore, there can be no doubt that if the material question had to be considered in the light of the bought and sold notes alone the appellant was acting on behalf of the disclosed principal and, on the contract thus entered into, it had no right to sue end can claim no cause of action in its favour.
In Gadd vs Houghton (1), James, L. J. Observed ""when a man says that he is making a contract 'on account of ' some one else, it seems to me that he uses the very strongest terms the English language affords to show that he is not binding himself, but is binding his principal"".
In that case fruit brokers in Liverpool gave a fruit merchant a sold note which read thus: ""We have this day sold to you on account of James Morand &; Co., Valentia, 2000 cases Valentia, oranges, of the brand James Morand & Co., at 12s.
per case free on board"", and the brokers signed the note without any addition.
The purchaser brought an action against the broker for non delivery of the oranges.
It was held that the words ""on account of James Morand & Co."" showed the intention to make the foreign principals and not the brokers liable and that the brokers were not liable upon the contract.
It would be noticed that (1)(1876) 98 in dealing with the question about the brokers liability two points fell to be Gonsidered.
The first point in support of fixing the liability with the brokers was that the brokers had signed this note without describing themselves as acting for the disclosed principals; and the argument was that ""when a man signs a contract in his name he is prima facie a contracting party and liable and there must be something very strong on the face of the instrument to show that the liability does not attach to him"".
This principle was accepted by the learned judge who decided the case; but it was pointed out that there was another fact which had an overriding effect and that was that the note showed that the brokers were acting for the diclosed principal, and that fact clearly repelled the brokers ' liability in regard to the contract.
In dealing with the argument about the effect of the signature Mellish, L. J. Observed ""when the signature comes at the end you apply it to everything which occurs throughout the contract.
If all that appears is that the agent has been making a contract on behalf of some other person, it seems to me to follow of necessity that that other person is the person liable.
This is one of the simplest possible case.
How can the words 'on account of Morand & Co. '. be inserted merely as a description ? The words mean that Morand & Co. are the people who have sold.
It follows that the persons who have signed are merely the brokers and are not liable"".
We have referred to there observations made by Mellish, L. J., because as we will presently point out they would be of material assistance in deciding the point which Mr. Pathak has raised on the strength of the two subsequent letters.
Thus, the bought and sold notes in this case unambiguously indicate that the appellant was acting for a disclosed principal and the contracting party was the disclosed principal and no other.
It is, however, urged by Mr. Pathak that before determining the terms of the contract and the 99 parties to it we must read the notes in question along with the two letters.
We have already seen the sequence of the documents.
First, the notes were delivered by the brokers to the appellant and the respondent.
Then the respective parties filed confirmation slips and then followed the two letters exchanged between them.
Mr. Pathak contends that in its letter addressed to the respondent the apellant has definitely stated that 'they ' had bought from the respondent 1000 bales in question.
Mr. Pathak places considerable emphasis on the use of the word ""we"" without reference to the principal; and he also relies on the fact that the letter is signed by the appellant without describing itself as acting on behalf of the principal already disclosed.
Similarly he relies on the statement of the respondent 's letter to the appellant that the respondent had sold to the appellant ""to you"" the bales in question.
According to Mr. Pathak the significance of these letters should not be underestimated in determining the parties to the contrat.
There is no doubt, and indeed it is a matter of common ground before us, that the letters do not constitute all the terms of the contract, and all that is urged by Mr. Pathak is that they should be consider along with the notes.
The notes refer to the fact that if any dispute arises in the deal it is subject to the arbitration by the Bengal Chamber of Commerce.
They also refer to the sales tax number which is to be furnished by the buyers, otherwise they would be charged.
These terms undoubtedly constitute terms of the contract; but the argument is that in the correspondence which took place between the parties there is no reference to the principal and indeed the correspondence proceeds on the basis that the appellant acts for itself and not for a disclosed principal, and that Should be borne in mind in deciding whether the appellant was acting for tho disclosed principal or not.
100 In support of his argument that the signature of the appellant to its letter of January 3, 1951, and the use of the word ""we"" in the first paragraph of he letter indicate that the appellant was acting for hi itself.
Mr. Pathak relies on a decision of the King 'section Bench Division in H. O. Brandt & Co. vs H.N. Morris o. Ltd. (1).
In that case the plaintiffs who carried on business in Manchester gave to the defendants a bought note dated September 3, 1914.
This note was addressed to the defendants and was headed From Messrs. H.O. Brandt & Co., 63 Granby Row Manchester, For and on behalf of Messrs. Sayles Bleacheries, Salesville, Rhode, Island, U. section A."".
The note stated ""we have this day bought from you 60 tone pure an line oil"" and it was signed ""H. O. Brandt & Co."".
The plaintiffs sued for non delivery of the oil.
Their claim was resisted on the ground that they had entered into the contract on behalf of a disclosed principal and therefore were not entitled to be sued.
It was held by Viscount Reading, C. J., and Scranton, L. J., Neville, J., dissenting, that the plaintiffs were the contracting parties and were entitled to sue upon the contract.
The majority decision was based on three grounds.
The first ground was that the plaintiffs had signed the note without describing themselves as acting on behalf of the principal and so it was held following the language used by Mellish, L. J., in the case of Gadd (2) that prima facie when a man signs a document in his own name and states therein ""I have this day bought from you"" he is the person liable on the contract.
The second consideration was that the reference to the foreign principal was made in the note in order to declare the destination of the goods.
There wax evidence adduced in the case to show that during wartime the destination of goods intended for export had to be made known.
Therefore the reference to the foreign principal was treated as having been made for the purpose of meeting the said (1) (2) (1876)1 exhibit D. 357.
101 requirement; and the third circumstance was that the plaintiff 's statement at the head of the note that they were acting for and on behalf of a foreign principal could not get rid of the prima facie presumption that a person signing a contract in his own name is personally liable on it.
It would thus be seen that the rule of construction which prescribes that if a person signs a contract prima facie he is the contracting party prevailed in that case because the reference to the disclosed principal was otherwise explained as serving another purpose altogether.
The said rule of construction prevailed also for the additional reason that the plaintiffs were acting for a foreign principal.
It would be remembered that 8. 230 of the Indian Contract Act provides that in the absence of any contract to that effect, an agent cannot personally enforce contracts entered into by him on behalf of his principal, nor is he personally bound by them.
There are, however, three cases specified in the section where such a contract would be presumed to exist; one of these cases is where a contract is made by an agent for sale or purchase of goods for a merchant resident abroad.
In other words, under section 230 if an agent enters into a contract for a disclosed foreign principal the main provision of section 230 will not apply because there would be a presumption that there is a contract to the contrary under which the agent would be personally bound by the contract notwithstanding the fact that he has entered into it on behalf of a foreign principal.
Therefore, we are not prepared to hold that the decision in the case of H. C. Brandt & Co. (1) lays down an unqualified rule of construction on which the appellant can rely.
In fact, it may be pointed out that Neville, J., who dissented from the majority view, has significantly observed that ""I rather gaudier that I should not have found myself in isolation on this point were it not for the fact that during the war there is an obligation to disclose the destination (1) [1917] 2 K.B.784.
102 of the goods"".
this observation shows that reference to the disclosed principal was not given its full effect in considering the question about the liability of the agent because it was held by the majority decision that the said reference was primarily, if not exclusively, made for the purposes of disclosing the destination of the goods.
In support of his argument that the relevant recitals in the two letters show that the contract had been entered into by the appellant on its own behalf Mr. Pathak has also referred us to the statement of the law made by Bowstead on ""Agency"".
""The question whether the agent is to be deemed to have contracted personally,"" it is observed, ""in the ease of contract in writing other than a bill of exchange, promissory note, or cheque, depends upon the intention of the parties, as appearing from the terms of the written agreement as a whole, the construction whereof is a matter of a law for the Court (a) if the contract be signed by the agent in his own name without qualification, he is deemed to have contracted personally, unless a contrary intention plainly appear from other portions of the document, (b) if the agent add words to his signature, indicating that he signs as an agent, or for or on behalf of a principal, he is deemed not to have contracted personally, unless it plainly appears from other portions of the document, that, notwithstanding such qualified signature, he intended to bind himself.
"" In conclusion it is added that ""effect should be given to every word used and none should be rejected unless it is apparent that they have been introduce per incuriam"" (P. 266, article 116).
These observations do not carry the appellant 's case very for because all that they show is that in determining the question as to whether the agent has entered into the contract on behalf of the principal or not the way he has signed the document has to be considered along with the other recitals made in the relevant documents.
103 What then would be the effect of the relevant recitals in the letter on which Mr. Pathak relies? In this connection it is necessary to recall that we are reading these letters along with the bought and sold notes, and that the bought and sold notes have unequivocally and clearly indicated that the appellant was acting on behalf and on account of the disclosed principal Khaitan & Sons.
If we read the letters in the light of the bought and sold notes it would be clear that the signature of the appellant will not have much significance, nor would the use of the word ""we"" by the appellant or ""you"" by the respondent make any difference.
Parties knew that the appellant was acting on behalf of the disclosed principal.
It is not suggested that in such a case every time the agent has to sign expressly stating that he is acting on behalf of the disclosed principal.
Therefore, if the appellant was acting for the disclosed principal the fact that he did not add the relevant description to his signature, or used the word ""we"" in the operative portion of the letter would not materially alter the fact spoken to by the notes that the appellant was acting on behalf of the disclosed principal.
It cannot be suggested that these letters intended to alter the position disclosed by the notes.
The letters, like the confirmation slips, are and must be, presumed to be consistent with the notes; and so it would be unreasonable to attach undue importance to the signature and to the use of the relevant words ""we"" and ""you"" on which reliance has been placed.
In our opinion, therefore, the appellate Court was right in holding that even if the bought and sold notes are read along with the confirmation slips and the two letters of January 3, 1961, and January 15, 1951, the conclusion is inescapable that the appellant entered into the contract on behalf of the disclosed principal Khaitan & Sons Ltd. If that be so, it follows as a matter of law that the appellant is not entitled to bring the present suit.
104 Mr. Pathak faintly attempted to argue in the alternative that even if the appellant was acting on behalf of the disclosed principal it would be entitled to sue because from the subsequent conduct of the parties a contract to the contrary could be reasonably inferred.
We have, however, not allowed Mr. Pathak to argue this point.
It was conceded by the appellant before the Appellate Court that if it was held that the plaintiff firm was acting as agent for Khaitan & Sons Ltd., the suit was not maintainable.
This concession was made in view of the provisions of section 236 of the Contract Act.
Besides, the alternative plea which Mr. Pathak wanted to raise does not appear to have been expressly pleaded or considered in the trial court.
In the result the appeal fails and is dismmissed.
In the circumstances of this case we direct that the parties should bear their own costs in this Court.
","The appellant sued the respondent for damages for breach of contract.
The respondent pleaded that the appellant had contracted as agent for its disclosed principal and had no right to sue.
The bought and sold notes issued by the brokers showed that the appellant had entered into the contract on account of the disclosed principal; but in the confirmation slips and subsequent letters exchanged between the parties no reference was made to the principal nor did the appellants describe themselves as acting or signing on his behalf.
^ Held, that it is well established in commercial usage that the bought and sold notes issued by the brokers, where 82 there is no variation or disparity between them, constitute the contract that must bind the parties.
But where the bought and sold notes show material variations, neither of them nor both of them taken together can be relied upon for proving the terms of the contract.
Since there was no disparity in the instant case between the two notes which specifically mentioned the appellants as acting on account of the disclosed partner, it must be held that the appellants had entered into the contract on behalf of the disclosed partner and as such was not entitled to sue.

Held, further, that in deciding whether or not the agent had entered into the contract on behalf of the principal, the way he signed the document must be considered in the light of the recitals in the relevant document.
In the instant case, the letters and the confirmation slips must be read in the light of the bought and sold notes and presumed to be consistent with them and it would, therefore, be unreasonable to attach undue importance to the signature or how the parties described themselves.
</s>","  This appeal by a certificate granted by the Calcutta High Court arises out of a suit filed by the three appellants against the respondent to recover Rs. 83,640/.
The three appellants are respectively the Firm Radhakrishan Shivdutt Rai which carries on business at Banaras and RamKumar Lal for himself and as karta of his joint family as well as Madan Gopal for himself and as karta of his joint family, the latter two being 83 the partners in the first mentioned Firm Radhakrishna Sivadutta Rai; for convenience we will refer to the partnership firm hereafter as the appellant.
The respondent Tayeballi Dawoodbhai is a partnership firm which carries on business at Calcutta.
The appellant's case was that the appellant and the respondent had entered into a contract in the first instance on December 18, 1980, through brokers named T. N. Mehrotra & co.
,Calcutta.
This contract was later confirmed by two letters written respectively on January 3 and 15, 1951, by the appellant to the respondent and replied to by the. respondent.
By this contract the respondent agreed to sell 1000 bales of Banaras Hemp particulars of which were set out in the plaint.
According to the appellant, by a letter written on March 14, 1951, the appellant in part performance of the said contract accepted delivery of 110 bales of Banaras Hemp No. 1 and 50 bales of Banaras Hemp No. 2; this delivery was Made by the respondent to L. N. Poddar & Co., who acted as the agent of the appellant and Paid the price of the said 160 bales.
In they transaction the respondent realised Rs. 3,840 from the said I.
N. Poddar & Co. in excess of the actual price of the goods delivered to the said company.
Inspite of the repeated demands made by the appellant the respondent failed to deliver the balance of the goods contracted for and thus committed breach of the contract.
That is how the appellant claimed Rs. (9,80(j as difference between the market rate on March 31, 1951, and the contract rate of the balance deliverable under the contract in suit.
This amount was claimed as damages for the breach of contract.
In addition an amount of Rs. 3,840 was claimed as having been paid in excess of tho value of 160 bales delivered to L. N. Poddar & Co., on behalf of the appellant.
This claim was resisted by the respondent on several grounds.
The principal contention urged by the respondent, however, was that in relation to the contract in suit the appellant had acted as agent for its disclosed principal Messrs. Khaitan and Sons Ltd., and as such it was not entitled to bring the present suit.
The respondent further alleged that the said disclosed principal Messrs. Khaitan and Sons had settled all their rights and loans under the suit contract with their agent and so the present claim for damages was not maintainable.
In regard to the claim for Rs. 3,840 the respondent pleaded that the appellant's case was untrue.
Several other pleas were also raised but with the said pleas we are not concerned in the present appeal.
Mr. Justice Bose who tried the suit framed twelve issues.
On the principal point in controversy between the parties the learned judge found that the appellant had entered into the contract with the respondent on its own account and not on account of the disclosed principal as alleged by the respondent.
According to the learned judge the reference to Messrs. Khaitan and Sons Ltd., made in the bought and sold notes on which the respondent's plea was based had been inserted by the brokers ""by mistake or due to some misconception.

"<s>[INST] Summarize:ition No. 6816 of 1981.
(Under Article 32 of the Constitution of India.) Kapil Sibal for the Petitioner.
274 B.D. Sharma for the Respondent.
The following judgments were delivered BHAGWATI, J.
The petitioner is the Director of a social action group called Social Work and Research Centre operating in and around Tilonia village in Ajmer district of the State of Rajasthan.
The Social Work and Research Centre is duly registered society and since February 1972, it has been actively engaged in the work of upliftment of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes in different areas and particularly in and around Tilonia village.
It operates through various groups and the present writ petition has been filed by the petitioner for the purpose of remedying gross violations of the which have been discovered by one such group.
These violations, according to the petitioner, have been taking place in the following circumstances and they need to be redressed through judicial intervention.
The Public Works Department of the State of Rajasthan is constructing Madanganj Harmara Road close to village Tilonia and according to the State Government, it is a part of famine relief work undertaken with a view to providing relief to persons affected by drought and scarcity conditions.
The State Government in the Public Works Department has engaged a large number of workers for construction of this road and they include women belonging to Scheduled Castes.
It is common ground that the minimum wage for a construction worker in Rajasthan is Rs. 7 per day and it was asserted on behalf of the petitioner and not disputed on behalf of the State Government that the Notification fixing the minimum wage of Rs. 7 per day does not specify any particular quantity of work to be turned out by the worker in order to be entitled to this minimum wage.
Now the practice followed by the Public Works Department for engaging workers for the construction work is to issue an identity card to every resident in the famine affected area who registers himself with the Halka patwari and the identity card would show the number of members in the family of the card holder including males, females and children.
Every resident in the famine affected area would be entitled to be employed in the famine relief work undertaken by the State Government on production of the identity card.
This way a large number of workers including women belonging to Scheduled Castes are engaged in the construction work of the Madanganj Harmara Road.
The workers employed in this construction work are divided into gangs of 20 persons or multiple 275 thereof and there is a separate muster roll for each such gang and the work done by it is measured every fortnight and payment is made by the Public Works Department to the Mate who is the leader of the gang according to the work turned out by such gang during each fortnight.
The Public Work Department has fixed a certain norm of work to be turned out by each gang before the workmen belonging to such gang can claim the minimum wage of Rs. 7 per day with the result that if any particular gang turns out work according to the norm fixed by the Public Works Department the Mate would be paid such amount as would on distribution give a wage of Rs. 7/ per day to the workmen constituting such gang, but if less work is turned out by such gang, payment to be made to the mate of such gang would be proportionately reduced and in that event, the wage earned by each member of such gang would fall short of the minimum of Rs. 7 per day.
The petitioner has stated in the writ petition that as a consequence of this practice followed by the Public Works Department workmen belonging to most of the gangs receive a wage very much less than the minimum wage of Rs. 7 per day as illustrated by a few instances set out in Annexure I to the writ petition.
The petitioner has also averred that even within the gang itself, deferential payments are made to the workmen without any visible principle or norm and it is not uncommon that a worker who has put in full day 's work throughout the period of the fortnight, may get less than the minimum wage of Rs.7/ per day, while a worker who has put in much less work may get more than the proportionate wage due to him.
This system of payment adopted by the Public Works Department created considerable discontent amongst the women workers belonging to Scheduled Castes who were engaged in this construction work and on 21st August 1981 about 200 to 300 such women workers approached the Social Work and Research Centre seeking advice as to what course of action should be adopted by them for the purpose of eliminating differential payments in wages and securing payment of minimum wage of Rs. 7 per day for each worker.
Mrs. Aruna Roy, the Development Coordinator of the Social Work and Research Centre thereupon contacted Shri Atul Gupta, Asstt.
Collector and both of them immediately proceeded to the site of the construction work.
On their arrival at the site, an impromptu meeting took place where the women workers gave vent to their grievances which included inter alia complaint in regard to the ""wide difference in respect of payments made by Mates to several gangs for the same category 276 of work performed"" and pointed out that ""differentials in payments also existed between the women workers working in the same gang and performing the same category of work.
"" Since these differential payments in wages were made by the Public Works Department to the gangs allegedly on the basis of the quantity of work turned out by each such gang and, according to the petitioner, there were even within the gang itself, differentials in payment of wages to the workers resulting in perpetuation of inequality, the petitioner in his capacity as Director of the Social Work and Research Centre filed the present writ petition challenging the system of payment of wages to the workers and seeking a writ of mandamus directing the State Government to ""comply with the prescribed rates of minimum wages under the as applicable in the State of Rajasthan.
"" When the writ petition reached hearing before us, the State Government produced the Rajsthan Famine Relief Works Employees (Exemption from Labour Laws) Act, 1964 (hereinafter referred to as the Exemption Act) and relying upon this statute, the State Government contended that since the construction work of Madangang Harmara Road was a famine relief work, the was not applicable to employees engaged on this construction work by reason of section 3 of this Act.
The Exemption Act is a Rajasthan statute enacted on 7th September 1964 and it is deemed to have come into force with effect from 1st July 1963.
Section 2 clause (b) of this Act defines ""famine relief works"" to mean ""works already started or which may hereafter be started by the State Government to provide relief to persons affected by drought and scarcity conditions"" and ""Labour Law"" is defined in section 2 clause (c) to mean ""any of the enactments as in force in Rajasthan relating to Labour and specified in the Schedule"".
The is one of the enactments specified in the Schedule to the Exemption Act.
Then section 3 of the Exemption Act proceeds to enact that ""Notwithstanding. .any such law."" Section 4 of the Exemption Act excludes the jurisdiction of courts and provides that ""no court shall take cognizance of any matter in respect of an employees of famine relief works under any Labour Law"", which includes the .
Now if the Exemption Act were a valid piece of legislation, it is obvious that no workman employed in a famine relief work would be entitled to complain that he is paid less than the minimum wage because the applicability of the would be 277 excluded by reason of section 3 of the Exemption Act and the women workers engaged in the construction work of Madanganj Harmara Road would have to be content with whatever wage is paid to them even though it be less than the minimum wage of Rs. 7 per day and their only complaint which would then survive would be that there is discrimination by reason of differential payment of wages to workmen doing the same quantity of work.
The petitioner therefore sought leave to amend the writ petition by including a challenge to the constitutional validity of the Exemption Act and on such leave being granted, the petitioner filed an amended writ petition in this Court.
The principal grounds on which the constitutionality of the Exemption Act was challenged were based on Articles 14 and 23 of the Constitution.
I am, for reasons which I shall presently state, of the view that the challenge under Article 23 is well founded and it is therefore not necessary to investigate the facts relating to the violation of Article 14 and I accordingly propose to confine my judgment only to a consideration of the attack based on Article 23.
If the Exemption Act is unconstitutional on the ground that it violates Article 23, it would be out of the way so far as the claim of the workmen for the minimum wage of Rs. 7 per day is concerned and the only question then would be whether the workmen are entitled to the minimum wage of Rs. 7 per day in any event or any deduction can be made from such minimum wage on the ground that the workmen have not turned out work according to the norm set down by the Public Works Department.
This Court had occasion to consider the true meaning and effect of Article 23 in a judgment given on 18th September 1982 in writ petition No. 8143 of 1981 Peoples Union for Democratic Rights and Ors.
vs Union of India and Ors.
(1) The Court pointed out that the constitution makers, when they set out to frame the Constitution, found that the practice of 'forced labour ' constituted an ugly and shameful feature of our national life which cried for urgent attention and with a view to obliterating and wiping out of existence this revolting practice which was a relic of a feudal exploitative society totally incompatible with new egalitarian socio economic order which ""We the people of India"" were determined to build, they enacted Article 23 in the Chapter on Fundamental Rights.
This Article, said the Court, is intended to eradicate the pernicious 278 practice of 'forced labour ' and to wipe it out altogether from the national scene and it is therefore not limited in its application against the State but it is also enforceable against any other person indulging in such practice.
It is designed to protect the individual not only against the state but also against other private citizens.
The Court observed that the expression ""other similar forms of forced labour"" in Article 23 is of the widest amplitude and on its, true interpretation it covers every possible form of forced labour begar or otherwise and it makes no difference whether the person forced to give his labour or service to another is remunerated or not.
Even if remuneration is paid, labour supplied by a person would be hit by this Article if it is forced labour, that is, labour supplied not willingly but as a result of force or compulsion and the same would be the position even if forced labour supplied by a person has its origin in a contract of service.
The Court then considered whether there would be any breach of Article 23 when a person provides labour or service to the State or to any other person and is paid less than the minimum wage for it and observed: ""It is obvious that ordinarily no one would willingly supply labour or service to another for less than the minimum wage, when he knows that under the law he is entitled to get minimum for the labour or service provided by him.
It may therefore be legitimately presumed that when a person provides labour or service to another against receipt of remuneration which is less than the minimum wage, he is acting under the force of some compulsion which drives him to work though he is paid less than what he is entitled under the law to receive.
What Article 23 prohibits is 'forced labour ' that is labour or service which a person is forced to provide and 'force ' which would make such labour or service 'forced labour ' may arise in several ways.
It may be physical force which may compel a person to provide labour or service to another or it may be forced exerted through a legal provision such as a provision for imprisonment or fine in case the employee fails to provide labour or service or it may even be compulsion arising from hunger and poverty, want and destitution.
Any factor which deprives a person of a choice of alternatives and compels him to adopt one particular course of action may properly be regarded as 'force 'and if labour or service is compelled as a result of such 279 'force ',it would be 'forced labour '.
Where a person is suffering from hunger or starvation, when he has no resources at all to fight disease or to feed his wife and children or even to hide their nakedness where utter grinding poverty has broken his back and reduced him to a state of helplessness and despair and where no other employment is available to alleviate the rigour of his poverty, he would have no choice but to accept any work that comes his way, even if the remuneration offered to him is less than the minimum wage.
He would be in no position to bargain with the employer; he would have to accept what is offered to him.
And in doing so he would be acting not as a free agent with a choice between alternatives but under the compulsion of economic circumstances and the labour or service provided by him would be clearly 'forced labour '.
There is no reason why the word 'forced ' should be read in a narrow and restricted manner so as to be confined only to physical or legal 'force ' particularly when the national charter, its fundamental document has promised to build a new socialist republic where there will be socioeconomic justice for all and everyone shall have the right to work, to education and to adequate means of livelihood.
The constitution makers have given us one of the most remarkable documents in history for ushering in a new socio economic order and the Constitution which they have forged for us has a social purpose and an economic mission and therefore every word or phrase in the constitution must be interpreted in a manner which would advance the socio economic objective of the Constitution.
It is not unoften that in a capitalist society economic circumstances exert much greater pressure on an individual in driving him to a particular course of action than physical compulsion or force of legislative provision.
The word 'force ' must therefore be construed to include not only physical or legal force but also force arising from the compulsion of economic circumstances which leaves no choice of alternatives to a person in want and compels him to provide labour or service even though the remuneration received for it is less than the minimum wage.
Of course, if a person provides labour or service to another against receipt of the minimum wage, it would not be possible to say that the labour or service provided by him is 'forced 280 labour ' because he gets what he is entitled under law to receive.
No inference can reasonably be drawn in such a case that he is forced to provide labour or service for the simple reason that he would be providing labour or service against receipt of what is lawfully payable to him just like any other person who is not under the force of any compulsion.
We are therefore of the view that where a person provides labour or service to another for remuneration which is less than the minimum wage, the labour or service provided by him clearly falls within the scope and ambit of the words 'forced labour ' under Article 23, Such a person would be entitled to come to the court for enforcement of his fundamental right under Article 23 by asking the court to direct payment of the minimum wage to him so that the labour or service provided by him ceases to be 'forced labour ' and the breach of Article 23 is remedied.
"" I must, therefore hold consistently with this decision that where a person provides labour or service to another for remuneration which is less than the minimum wage,the labour or service provided by him clearly falls within the meaning of the words 'forced labour ' and attracts the condemnation of Article 23.
Every person who provides labour or service to another is entitled at the least to the minimum wage and if anything less than the minimum wage is paid to him he can complain of violation of his fundamental right under Article 23 and ask the court to direct payment of the minimum wage to him so that the breach of Article 23 may be abated.
If this be the correct position in law, it is difficult to see how the constitutional validity of the Exemption Act in so far as it excludes the applicability of the Minimum wages Act 1948 to the workmen employed in famine relief works can be sustained.
Article 23, as pointed out above, mandates that no person shall be required or permitted to provide labour or service to another on payment of anything less than the minimum wage and if the Exemption Act, by excluding the applicability of the , provides that minimum wage may not be paid to a workman employed in any famine relief work, it would be clearly violative of Article 23.
The respondent however contended that when the State undertakes famine relief work with 281 a view to providing help to the persons affected by drought and scarcity conditions, it would be difficult for the State to comply with the labour laws, because if the State were required to observe the laws, the potential of the State to provide employment to the affected persons would be crippled and the State would not be able to render help to the maximum number of affected persons and it was for this reason that the applicability of the was excluded in relation to workmen employed in famine relief work.
This contention, plausible though it may seem is in, my opinion, unsustainable and cannot be accepted.
When the State undertakes famine relies work it is no doubt true that it does so in order to provide relief to persons affected by drought and scarcity conditions but none the less it is work which enures for the benefit of the State representing the society and if labour or service is provided by the affected persons for carrying out such work, there is no reason why the State should pay anything less than the minimum wage to the affected persons.
It is not as if a dole or bounty is given by the State to the affected persons in order to provide relief to them against drought and scarcity conditions nor is the work to be carried out by the affected persons worthless or useless to the society so that under the guise of providing work what the State in effect and substance seeks to do is to give dole or bounty to the affected persons.
The court cannot proceed on the basis that the State would undertake by way of famine relief, work which is worthless and without utility for the society and indeed no democratic State which is administered by a sane and sensible Government would do so because it would be sheer waste of human labour and resource which can usefully be diverted into fruitful and productive channels leading to the welfare of the community and creation of national asset or wear.
It is difficult to appreciate why the State should require the affected persons to provide labour or service on work which is of no use to the society, instead of simply distributing dole or bounty amongst the affected persons.
There is no reason which the State should resort to such a camouflage.
The presumption therefore must be that the work undertaken by the State by way of famine relief is useful to the society and productive in terms of creation of some asset or wealth and when the State exacts labour or service from the affected persons for carring out such work, for example, a bridge or a road, which has utilised for the society and which is going to augment the wealth of the State, there can be no justification for the State not to pay minimum wage to the affected persons.
The State cannot be permitted to take advantage of the 282 helpless condition of the affected persons and extract labour or service from them on payment of less than the minimum wage.
No work of utility and value can be allowed to be constructed on the blood and sweat of persons who are reduced to a state of helplessness on account of drought and scarcity conditions.
The State cannot under the guise of helping these affected persons extract work of utility and value from them without paying them the minimum wage.
Whenever any labour or service is taken by the State from any person, whether he be affected by drought and scarcity conditions or not, the State must pay, at the least, minimum wage to such person on pain of violation of Article 23 and the Exemption Act in so far as it excludes the applicability of the to workmen employed on famine relief work and permits payment of less than the minimum wage to such workmen, must be held to be invalid as offending the provisions of Article 23.
The Exemption Act cannot in the circumstances be relied upon by the respondent as exempting it from the liability to pay minimum wage to the workmen engaged in the construction work of Madanganj Harmara Road.
We must then proceed to consider whether on the facts the labour provided by the workers employed in the construction work of Madanganj Harmara Road could be said to be 'forced labour on the ground that they received wage less than Rs.7 per day.
Now it was not disputed on behalf of the respondent that the wage paid to a gang of workmen depended upon the work turned out by a particular gang and if it was less than the norm fixed by the Public Works Department, the wage earned by each member of the gang would fall short of the minimum wage of Rs. 7 per day.
But the argument was that this did not involve any breach of Article 23 because if any particular gang turned out work according to the norm fixed by the Public Works Department, the amount paid to the Mate of the gang was enough to give to each workman, on distribution, the minimum wage of Rs. 7 per day, and it was only if less work was turned out by the gang that the workmen would receive less than the minimum wage of Rs. 7 per day and this result would ensue not on account of any default on the part of the respondent but entirely because of the lethargy of the workmen constituting the gang.
The workmen, said the respondent, could always earn the minimum wage of Rs. 7 per day by turning out work according to the norm fixed by the Public Works Department but if they did not do so and in consequence received less than the minimum 283 wage of Rs. 7 per day the respondent could not be held responsible for breach of the fundamental right conferred under article 23.
This argument does, at first blush, appear to be attractive, but a closer scrutiny will reveal that it is unfounded.
If we look at the Notification issued under the fixing the minimum wage of Rs. 7 per day for workmen employed in the construction work, it will be obvious that the minimum wage is fixed per day and not with reference to any particular quantity of work turned out by the workman during the day.
Nor does the Notification empower the employer to fix any particular norm of work to be carried out by the workman with reference to which the minimum wage shall be paid by the employer.
The minimum wage is not fixed on piece rate basis, so that a particular minimum wage would be payable only if a certain amount of work is turned out by the workman and if he turns out less work, then the minimum wage payable would be proportionately reduced.
Here the minimum wage is fixed at Rs. 7 per day and that is the minimum wage which must be paid by the employer to the workman so long as the workman works throughout the working hours of the day for which he can lawfully be required to work.
The employer may fix any norm he thinks fit specifying the quantity of work which must he turned out by the workman during the day, but if the workman does not turn out work in conformity with such norm, the employer cannot pay him anything less than the minimum wage.
If the norm fixed by the employer is reasonable and the workman does not turn out work according to such norm, disciplinary action may be taken against the workman and in a given case he may ever be liable to be thrown out of employment, but he cannot be paid less than the minimum wage, unless, of course, the minimum wage fixed by the Notification under the is co related with the quantity of work to be turned out by the workman.
Otherwise, it would be the easiest thing for the employer to fix an unreasonably high norm which a workman working diligently and efficiently during the day cannot possibly reach and thereby deprive the workman of the minimum wage payable to him.
There can therefore be no doubt that in the present case the respondent was not entitled to pay less than the minimum wage to the workman belonging to a gang on the ground that such gang turned out work less than the norm fixed by the Public Works Department.
I must therefore hold that each workman employed in the construction work of Madanganj Harmara Road was entitled to 284 receive the minimum wage of Rs. 7 per day from the respondent and the respondent was not entitled to reduce the wage payable to the workman below the minimum of Rs. 7 per day on the ground that the gang of which the workman was a member had turned out work less than the norm fixed by the Public Works Department.
I would accordingly direct the respondent to pay to each workman employed in the construction work of Madanganj Harmara Road the difference between the minimum wage of Rs. 7 per day and the actual wage paid during the period that the workman provided labour on this construction work.
I do not think it should be difficult for the State to carry out this direction since the workman employed on this construction work are all residents of the surrounding area and the muster roll maintained by the Public Works Department would give the particulars of such workmen.
I would direct that the arrears of difference between the minimum wage of Rs. 7 per day and the actual wage disbursed shall be paid by the respondent to the workmen within two months from today and a report to that effect shall be submitted by the respondent to this Court on or before 30th April, 1983 setting out particulars of the payments made and the names of the workmen to whom such payments are made.
I would also direct that the State shall hereafter pay to each workman employed in any famine relief work including the construction work of Madanganj Harmara Road, minimum wage for the labour provided in such construction work and no deduction in the minimum wage shall be made on the ground that the work turned out by such workman is less than the norm fixed by the Public Works Department, unless and until a notification is issued under the co relating the minimum wage with a particular quantity of work to be turned out by the workman.
Since the petitioners have succeeded in the writ petition, the respondent will pay the costs of the writ petition to the petitioners.
PATHAK J. I agree with the order proposed by my learned brother.
But while he has found substance in the contention that the case is one of ""forced labour"" within the meaning of article 23 of the Constitution, I prefer to rest my decision on the ground that there is a breach of article 14 of the Constitution.
It appears that in order to provide relief to persons affected by drought and scarcity conditions in the area, employment has been offered in the construction of the Madanganj Harmara Road 285 Payment of wages for the day is determined by the Public Works Department on the basis of a standard norm of work, the wage for completing the daily standard norm being fixed at Rs. 7.
It may be noted that the minimum wage prescribed under the in respect of such work is also Rs. 7 per day.
The Public Works Department has declared that if the quantum of work turned out during the day is less than the fixed standard norm the workers will be paid a mere proportionate amount of the wage of Rs. 7 per day, that is to say they will be entitled to a reduced wage only.
Sanction for not adhering to the prescribed minimum wage of Rs. 7 per day and making payment of a lesser wage has been drawn from section 3 of the Rajasthan Famine Relief Works Employees (Exemption from Labour Laws) Act, 1964, which in provides, inter alia, that the will not apply to famine relief works or the employees thereof.
The being thus out of the way, it is open to the Public Works Department to prescribe whatever wages norms it considers appropriate for payment to persons, employed by way of relief, who are affected by drought and scarcity conditions.
It is apparent that in the matter of wages such persons have been treated as a class different from that to which workers from other areas belong.
While the latter are entitled under the to the prescribed minimum wage, the former must be content with a lesser wage if the work turned out is less than the norm.
To my mind, there is no justification for such discrimination.
The circumstance that employment has been given to persons affected by drought and scarcity conditions provides only the reason for extending such employment.
In other words, the granting of relief to persons in distress by giving them employment constitutes merely the motive for giving them work.
It cannot affect their right to what is due to every worker in the course of such employment.
The rights of all the workers will be the same, whether they are drawn from an area affected by drought and scarcity conditions or come from elsewhere.
The mere circumstance that a worker belongs to an area effected by drought and scarcity conditions can in no way influence the scope and sum of those rights.
In comparison with a worker belonging to some other more fortunate area and doing the same kind of work, is he less entitled than the other to the totality of those rights? Because he belongs to a distressed area, is he liable in the computation of his wages, to be distinguished from the other by the badge of his misfortune? The prescription of equality in Art, 286 14 of the Constitution gives one answer only, and that is a categorical negative.
It is urged for the respondents that employment is provided to all able bodies inhabitants of the area as a measure of relief in their distress and it has been considered desirable to provide employment to all, even though at a wage below the prescribed minimum wage, than to provide employment to some only at the prescribed minimum wage.
The argument evidently proceeds on the assumption that the wages are drawn from a fund too limited to provide for payment of a minimum wage to all.
I see no justification for proceeding on that assumption.
When the State employs workers for doing work needed on its development projects, it must find funds for such projects.
And the fund must be sufficient to ensure the prescribed minimum wage to each worker, and this is particularly so having regard to the concept of a ""minimum wage.
"" It seems to me that by prescribing the criterion which it has, the Public Works Department has effected an invidious discrimination bearing no reasonable nexus to the object behind the employment.
In my judgment, the workers employed in the construction of the Madanganj Harmara Road as a measure of relief in a famine stricken area are entitled to a minimum wage of Rs. 7 per day, and that wage cannot be reduced by reference to the Rajasthan Famine Relief Works Employees (Exception from Labour Laws) Act, 1964 because in so far as the provisions of section 3 OF that Act countenance a lesser wage they operate against Art 14 of the Constitution and are, therefore, void.
S.R. Petition allowed.
","The respondent State in the public Works Department has engaged a large number of workers for the construction of Madanganj Harmara Road, close to Tilonia village with a view to providing relief to persons affected by drought and scarcity conditions.
The workers employed in this construction work are divided into gangs of 20 persons or multiple thereof and for each gang one muster roll is maintained.
The work done by each gang is measured every fortnight and payment is made by the Public Works Department to the Mate who is the leader of the gang according to the work turned out by such gang during each fortnight.
The Public Works Department has fixed a certain norm of work to be turned out by each gang before the workmen belonging to such gang can claim the minimum wage of Rs. 7 per day with the result that if any particular gang turns out work according to the norm fixed by the Public Works Department, the Mate would be paid such amount as would be on distribution give a wage of Rs. 7 per day to the workmen constituting such gang, but if less work is turned out by such gang, payment to be made to the mate of such gang would be proportionately reduced and in that event, the wage earned by each member of such gang would fall short of the minimum wage of Rs. 7 per day.
Further, this system of proportionate distribution of the wages adopted without any visible principle or norm enabled a workman who has put in less work to get more payment than the person who has really put in more work.
Hence the public interest writ petition filed by the Director of the Social Work and Research Centre, complaining violation of the provisions of the , Articles 14 and 23 of the Constitution, and the vires of section 3 of the Rajasthan Famine Relief Works Employees (Exemption from Labour Laws) Act, 1964.
Allowing the Petition, the Court ^ HELD: 1.
Where a person provides labour or service to another for remuneration which is less than the minimum wage, the labour or service provided by him clearly falls within the meaning of the words 'forced labour ' and attracts the condemnation of Article 23.
Every person who provides labour or service to another is entitled at the least to the minimum wage and if anything less than the minimum wage is paid to him, he can complain of violation of his 272 fundamental right under Article 23 and ask the court to direct payment of the minimum wage to him so that the breach of Article 23 may be abated.
[280 D F] 2: 1.
The constitutional validity of the Exemption Act in so far as it excludes the applicability of the providing that minimum wage may not be paid to a workman employed in any famine relief work, cannot be sustained in the face of Article 23.
Article 23 mandates that no person shall be required or permitted to provide labour or service to another on payment of anything less than the minimum wage.
Whenever any labour or service is taken by the State from any person, whether he be affected by drought and scarcity conditions or not, the State must pay, at the least, minimum wage to such person on pain of violation of Article 23.
[280 F G, 282 B C] 2: 2.
When the State undertakes famine relief work, it is no doubt true, that it does so in order to provide relief to persons affected by drought and scarcity conditions but, none the less it is work which enures for the benefit of the State representing the society and if labour or service is provided by the affected persons for carrying out such work, the State cannot pay anything less than the minimum wages to the affected persons.

The State cannot be permitted to take advantage of the helpless condition of the affected persons and extract labour or service from them on payment of less than the minimum wage.
No work of utility and value can be allowed to be constructed on the blood and sweat of persons who are reduced to a state of helplessness on account of drought and scarcity conditions.
[281 B E, H, 282 A] 2: 3.
In the instant case, the Notification issued under the makes it clear that the minimum wage of Rs. 7 is fixed per day and not with reference to any particular quantity of work turned out by the workmen during the day.
The Notification does not empower the employer to fix any particular norm of work to be carried out by the workman with reference to which the minimum wage shall be paid by the employer.
The minimum wage is not fixed on piece rate basis, so that a particular minimum wage would be payable only if a certain amount of work is turned out by the workman and if he turns out less work, then the minimum wage payable would be proportionately reduced.
Here the minimum wage is fixed at Rs. 7 per day and that is the minimum wage which must be paid by the employer to the workman so long as the workman works throughout the working hours of the day for which he can lawfully be required to work.
The employer may fix any norm he thinks fit specifying the quantity of work which must be turned out by the workman during the day, but if the workman does not turn out work in conformity with such norm, the employer cannot pay him anything less than the minimum wage.
If the norm fixed by the employer is reasonable and the workman does not turn out work according to such norm, disciplinary action may be taken against the workman and in a given case he must even be liable to be thrown out of employment, but he cannot be paid less than the minimum 273 wage, unless, of course, the minimum wage fixed by the Notification under the is correlated with the quantity of work to be turned out by the workman.
Otherwise, it would be the easiest thing for the employer to fix an unreasonably high norm which a workman working diligently and efficiently during the day cannot possibly reach and thereby deprive the workman of the minimum wage payable to him.

PER PATHAK, J. 1.
The workers employed in the construction of the Madanganj Harmara Road as a measure of relief is a famine stricken area are entitled to a minimum wage of Rs. 7 per day, and that wage cannot be reduced by reference to the Rajasthan Famine Relief Works Employees (Exemption and Labour Laws) Act 1964, because in so far as the provisions of section 3 of that Act countenance a lesser wage they operate against Article 14 of the Constitution and are, therefore, void.[286 D E] 2:1.
By prescribing the criterion which it has, the Public Works Department has effected an invidious discrimination bearing no reasonable nexus to the object behind the employment.
[286 C D] 2:2 The circumstance that employment has been given to persons affected by drought and scarcity conditions provides only the reason for extending such employment.
In other words, the granting of relief to persons in distress by giving them employment constitutes merely the motive for giving them work.
It cannot affect their right to what is due to every worker in the course of such employment.
The rights of all the workers will be the same, whether they are drawn from area affected by drought and scarcity conditions or come from elsehwere.
The mere circumstance that a worker belongs to an area affected by drought and scarcity conditions can in no way influence the scope and sum of those rights.
In comparison with a worker belonging to some other more fortunate area and doing the same kind of work, he is not less entitled than the other to the totality of those rights nor liable to be distinguished from the other by the badge of his misfortune.
[285 E G] 2: 3.
When the State employs workers for doing work needed on its development projects, it must find funds for such projects.
And the fund must be sufficient to ensure the prescribed minimum wage to each worker and this is particularly so having regard to the concept of a ""minimum wage"".
Therefore, the argument that the wages are drawn from a fund too limited to provide for payment of a minimum wage to all is not justified.

The Judgment of the Court was delivered by YOGESHWAR DAYAL, J.
This is an appeal by the four accused persons against the judgment of the Bombay High Court dated 16th November.
Appellant No. 1 who was accused No. 1 was tried for the offence of having 880 committed the murder of his daughter in law Sangita, wife of appellant No. 2 who was accused No.2, during the night between 14th September, 1984 and 15th September, 1984 at the residential house of the appellants at Murtizapur with common intention and also for having treated her with cruelty on account of dowry amount.

Appellant no.3, who was accused No.3, is the wife of accused No.1 and appellant No.4, who was accused No. 4.
is their daughter.
Appellants 1 to 4 are hereinafter called accused Nos. 1 to 4.
The story of the prosecution was as follows: The accused run a printing press at their residence.
Marriage of accused No. 2 was settled with the 5th daughter of Madan lal (PW. 8).
Few days prior to the settlement of the marriage.
marriage of her elder sister was also settled.
As such marriages of both the daughters i.e. Sangita and Hemlata were celebrated at Paratwada on 28th April, 1994.
Talk over the marriage had taken place about a month prior to the marriage and the same was finalised after about 2 or 3 days of such talks.
At the time of finalisation, accused No. 1 demanded Rs. 20,000 by way of hard cash as dowry, besides other articles, add he himself had given such demands in writing vide Ext.
Though agreed, Madan Lal, father of the deceased could not give Rs. 20,000 at the time of marriage.
He also could not give the gold agreed, though he assured to comply with the demands later on getting the crops.
After the marriage, on account of the month of Shrawan, and as per custom, Sangita resided with her parents.
It was during her stay after the marriage that she was found disturbed and sullen.
Though she herself did not give out the reason therefore, but on insistence by the father to know the reason she told him that accused No. 1 had an evil eve on her and that other members of the family used to beat and ill treat her because of the failure on the part of Madan Lai to pay the dowry amount.
Though Madan lal assured that he would come down to Murtizapur and pursued the accused, but he could not visit Murtizapur.
After the month of Shrawan, Sangita returned to Murtizapur but not communication was made about her safe return by the accused persons to her father.
The accused persons had a telephone connection and Madan Lal (PW.8), two three days prior to the date of the incident contacted accused No. 1 on telephone.
Accused No. 1 talked angrily with Madan Lal.
Madan Lal then requested accused No. 1 to call Sangita on telephone.
Sangita came on phone and in answer to his query she broke down and Stated weeping and told Madan lal as to why he did not send Ganesh Chaturthi Neg ', 'Neg ' means a customary offer that the father of the bride has to pay on an auspicious day.
It varies according to financial capacity of the father.
He told 881 Sangita that he had committed it mistake and assured that he would be sending it immediately.
On the next day lie had got drawn a draft of Rs. 101/ on State Bank of India.
74 A is the said draft.
It was thereafter when Madan Lai was on a visit to Amravati that Madan Lal received a message about Sangita having got burnt on 15th September, 1984.
During the night between 14th and 15th September.
1984 at about midnight the accused found Sangita not in her bed and smell of burning.
They found that in the rear side open space Sangita was burning and lying down.
According to the defence the doors were closed from inside and there was no access to the said open space.
Accused No. 1 informed the police about the occurrence that he had seen through the window opening on the )pen space.
Accused No. 1 at about 3.45 a.m. on 15th September, 1994 submitted it report (Ext.82) to the police wherein he had stated that about 2. 10 a.m. in the night Sangita was found to be burnt and died in the bath room.
Mundheh.
the investigating Officer gave instructions to the accused persons not to disturb the situation.
Initially on the report of the accused, accidental death was registered.
PW9 when reached the spot on 15th September.
1984 at about 10.00 a.m. he made spot Panchnama vide ext.63.
He also found a postcard.
half burnt, (Ext. 62) by the side of the dead body.
He thereafter drew inquest panchnama (Ext.64).
PW. 1 Bhanudas acted as a panch.
PW.9 having convinced that it was a case of murder, lodged it report on behalf of the State registering the offence punishable under Section 302 read with Section 34 of the Indian Penal Code.
Dr. Lande, PW.3, on 15th September, 1994 at about 5.00 p.m. conducted the post mortem.
The Additional Sessions Judge on the basis of the material filed with the challan.
on 30th September, 1994 trained a charge under Sections 302.499 A and 201 read with Section 34 of the Indian Penal code and thereafter recorded the evidence of PWs.
1 to 9.
Thereafter by an order dated 22nd August, 1988 the trial court framed an additional charge for the offence punishable under Section 306 read with Section 34 of the Indian Penal Code.
The accused persons challenged the framing of the additional charge before the High Court but the challenge was defeated.
The accused persons were accordantly tried.
Their defence through out was a total denial.
It appears that during arguments the Prosecutor did not think it proper to press for the diffence punishable under Section 302 read with Section 34 of the Indian penal Code.
According to the Prosecutor the only case made out was for the offences punishable under Sections 306, 498 A read with Section 34 of the Indian Penal Code.
The trial court endorsed the view of the Public Prosecutor and did not 882 discuss the relevant evidence it all on the charge of Section 302 and recorded a finding of acquittal in that behalf.
He also held that the charge of Section 201 also did not survive.
The learned trial Judge also held that the prosecution hits not been able it) prove that the accused persons with their common intention treated Sangita with cruelty or thereby abetted her to commit suicide.
He accordingly acquired all the accused persons for the offence punishable under Section 306 read with Section 34 of the Indian Penal Code.
The State filed all appeal against their order of acquittal and the High Court on appeal castigated the trial judge for having gone merely oil the statement of the public Prosecutor without applying his own mind on the evidence.
The High Court examined the evidence afresh.
The High Court posed a question is to whether the nature of death of Sangita was suicidal or homicidal and ultimately gave a finding that it was a case of homicidal death and found all the accused guilty under Section 302 read With Section 34 and Section 201 read with Section 34.
The accused were also find guilty under Sections 498 A read with Section 34.
For the offence under Section 302 read with Section 34 all of them were sentenced to rigorous imprisonment `for life and different fines.
For the offence under Section 201 read with Section 34 all the accused persons were sentenced to rigorous imprisonment for three years and each of them was fined Rs.1,000/ .
For the offence under Section 498 A read with Section 34 all of them were sentenced to one year rigorous imprisonment and a fine of Rs.2,000.
Learned counsel for the defence, however, submitted before the High Court that the charge under Section 302 read with Section 34 did not survive tit view of the concession made by the Prosecutor and also in view of the framing of the additional charge under Section 306 read with Section 34.
It was also submitted that the framing of the additional charge negated the theory of murder in pith and substance.
The High Court, however negatived this submission and on consideration of the evidence convicted all the accused persons as stated above.
Body of Sangita suffered 100% burn injuries and smell of kerosene was even noticed in the spot panchanama.
The description 1005 burn does not really fully 883 convey the condition of the body.
Asper the inquest report the dead body was lying on its back in the open court yard at the back side of the house of the accused.
Both the legs were partly stiffen.
Both the hands were partly bent and lying at side.
Hairs on the head burnt and even fleshy portion is also burnt at some places.
There was slight hair at some portion of head.
Complete body was burnt and skin on it also peeled up.
Face had became red and black.
Eyes were closed and burnt.
Nose was burnt and blood was cozing from the nose and mouth.
Tongue was slightly protruding out.
Brassier of the left side was totally burnt and right side was partly burnt.
Ash of burnt cloth was visible on stomach.
A partly burnt small piece of the border of saree was lying there.
Some pieces of saree, burnt and sticking each other, were lying on the stomach.
Skin on palm of both hands was peeled up and was appearing reddish.
Skin on the complete body was burnt and peeled up.
On observing the body by turning its upside down, the complete body was burnt from back side.
On observing the private parts of the deceased through Pancha No.3 it was stated that private parts were burnt and there was no injury and to ascertain the actual cause of death, the dead body was sent to the Civil Surgeon, Murtizapur for post mortem.
According to Dr. Lande, who conducted the postmortem, on opening of trachea black particles were found.
He recorded that probable cause of death was 100% burn with bum shock with asphysix.
On the basis of medical evidence the High Court again felt the necessity to ascertain whether the act of pouring kerosene oil was voluntarily by the victim or the act of a third person.
The High Court felt that the trial court has not even discussed the medical evidence or the inquest report and hastily reached the conclusion that it was a case of suicidal death.
According to the High Court the entire approach of the trial court was thoroughly unsatisfactory and grossly erroneous.
After going through the evidence the High Court gave the following findings: That the deceased could not control her emotional out burst even during the presence of her father in law while talking on telephone.
The deceased was a young girl of 20 years.
A determination to suffer extreme pain in silence could not be a matter of speculation.
""In third degree injuries, as per Dr. Lande, the victim suffers extreme pain.
Such injuries will make the person to give out cries and shouts for help."" The shouting and crying of the deceased was not only obvious but inevitable.
Undisputedly, none had heard the cries or shouts of the deceased while she was in flames.
This circumstance alone does not support the probability of suicidal death.
884 The trial court has wrongly read the contents of letter Ext.
62 and its interpretation is highly illegal.
Undisputedly Sangita returned from Paratwada after ""Shrawani Mass"" just a week before the incident, probably by 7th September, 1984.
She was subjected ' to insinuation and accused used to refer her as ""awara"", ""loafer"".
""badmash"", She wanted to convey this to her father through post card (Ext.62) which seemingly not delivered.
By this letter she requested her father not to visit Murtizapur.
This letter never reached post off ice and the message could not be passed to Madan Lai, PW. 8.
Before accomplishing her design to convey this message, she could not bring an end to her life.
Sangita could not simply think of committing suicide while in possession of Ext.62.
Sangita at the time of incident, as per the post mortem report.
was having, a pregnancy of 3 4 months and this is also not in tune with the act of commission of suicide.
The Sessions Judge omitted to discuss the complete evidence of Dr. Lande and the post mortem report Ext.50.
As per post mortem report the eye ball and tongue of the deceased were protruding.
Dozing of the blood was found from the nose and mouth.
In case of death due to burning such injuries cannot be sustained.
Sangita was assaulted before she was set on fire.
There might be a definite attempt to cause death by strangulation before pouring kerosene oil on her person.
Relying of the evidence of PW.1, Shivraj, a neighbour who heard a shriek of ' woman as a result of strangulation coming from the house of the accused.
Taking into account tile medical evidence read with the testimony of PW.1, Shivraj, Sangita met with tile homicidal death.
A ball of cloth half burnt was also found by the side of the body.
The ball was used for gagging her mouth as a precautionary measure to handicap her from raising cries or shouts.
PW.5, Bhanudas, had also noticed dragging marks in the court yard and the deceased after assault was dragged and kept at the spot.
While in flames Sangita did not make any movement.
She was completely motionless.
The latching of doors of the compound was not accepted as an act of the deceased.
Latching of doors and pouring of kerosene after assault was a farcical venture skilfully and conveniently made to bring colour of suicide to the incident.
885 The High Court then posed the question as to who is responsible for homicidal death of Sangita.
It was held that it could not be an act of an individual It was joint venture.
There is no direct evidence.
Undisputedly the payment of Rs.20,000/ was not made nor the tither items mentioned in Ext.
73 were given till the date of incident.
On her second visit, the deceased had disclosed to her father, Madan Lal.
that the members of in laws ' family had beaten and ill treated her for the reason of non fulfillment of dowry and other articles.
A reading of the letter indicates that the accused persons had very serious grievance against Sangita and her parents for non fulfillment of dowry demands.
Recovery of handkerchief at the instance of accused No. 1 in pursuance of a disclosure statement and the seizure thereof vide Ext.69 from a drawer of the table of the office.
The handkerchief was smelling, kerosene oil.
It was concealed at a place which was not normally or ordinarily used for keeping the handkerchief.
This handkerchief was used at the time of the incident.
None of the accused persons made any attempt to reach the spot even though they noticed the death of Sangita.
They merely allowed the body to be burnt.
Accused persons had quoted exact time of death in Ext.82 which means that they were mentally alert and conscious of the happening in the house.
The refusal to disclose the death of Sangita to the chowkidar of the locality, PW.2, Rahadursingh.
The meeting with chowkidar Bahadursingh was falsely denied in the statement under Section 313 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.
Homicidal death occurred by Sangita while she was in their custody.
The incident with its gravity and extent cannot in any manner go unnoticed.
As such the accused persons were duty bound to offer plausible explanation.
Their action was concerted.
well thought out.
well planned.
With the aforesaid findings all the accused persons were found guilty by the High Court and the appellants have come up in appeal before this Court.
This court on application of appellant Nos. 3 and 4 i.e. another in law and sister in law of the deceased, admitted them to be on hail.
Apart from the inferences noticed by the High Court there are certain other features in the post mortem report Ext.
15 which may also be noticed at this state.
It is stated in paragraph 13 of the post mortem report that the whole (if skin of face 886 was burnt and Covered at places with black soot.
Eye ball slightly protruding Tongue was protruding from mouth.
Blood stained discharge from nose and mouth.
In paragraph 17 it is noticed heirs of the scalp, eye lashes, both ears, eyes, whole neck.
whole chest.
whole abdomen suffer from burns.
Buttock and pubic hairs also burnt.
Black soot was present over burnt area of face, chest, abdomen.
In paragraph 19 it is stated Brain & Meninges congested.
In paragraph 20 it is stated Larynx.
Trachea and Bronchi congested, on opening, troches.
black particles seen inside human.
Right lung left lung congested.
Right ventricle of the heart was full whereas left was empty.
In paragraph 21 it is stated liver and gall bladder congested.
pancreas and suprarenals congested.
spleen congested, kidneys congested and bladder empty, i.e. parenchymatous organs show intense venous congestion.
Dr. K.S. Narayan Reddy, M.D. D.C.P., M.I.A.F.M., F.I.M.S.A.,F.A.F.Sc., Professor of Forensic Medicine, Osmania Medical College Hyderabad in his well known treatise THE ESSENTIALS OL FFORENSIC MEDICINE AND TOXICOLOGY.
Sixth Education at page 255 gives descriptions of internal as well as external symptoms of manual strangulation.
At page 255 while dealing with signs of asphyxia.
the learned author observes : ""The face may be livid, blotchy and swollen, the eyes wide open, bulging and suffused, the pupils dialated, the tongue swollen, dark cloured and protruded.
Petechial hemorrhages are common into the skin of the eyelids, face, forehead, behind the cars and scalp.
Bloody froth may escape front the mouth and nostrils and there may he bleeding from the nose and cars.
The hands are usually clenched.
The genital organs may be congested and there may be discharge of urine, faeces and seminal fluid.
"" While internal injuries described little later included as under ""The larynx.
trachea and bronchi are congested and contain frothy.
often blood stained mucus.
The lungs are markedly congested and show ecchymoses and larger subaerial hemorrhages.
Dark fluid blood exudes on section.
Silvery looking spots under the pleural surface due to rupture of the air cells which disappear on pricking.
are seen in more than 505 cases.
The parenchymatous organs show intense venous congestion and in young persons ecchymoses are usually seen on the heart and kidneys.
The brain is contested and shows petechial hemorrhages.
The right side of the heart is full of dark fluid blood and the left empty.
Both the cavities are full if the heart stopped during diastole.
"" Whereas in burn injuries the learned author at pages 237 238 observes.
""the 887 brain is usually shrunken, firm and yellow to light brown due to cooking.
The dura matter is leathery."" (dura matter is meninges of the brain).
If the death has occoured from suffocation.
aspirated blackish coal particles are seen in the nose, mouth and whole of the respiratory track.
Their presence is proof that the victim was alive %,.hen tile fire occurred.
The pleurae are contested or inflamed.
The lungs are usually congested.
may be strunken and rarely anemic.
Visceral congestion is marked in many cases.
The heart is usually filled with clotted blood. 'The adarme;s (glands above kidneys) may he enlarged and congested.
Some of these symptoms or internal and external injuries are common in case of strangulation and burn like face is swollen and distorted, the tongue protruded.
the lungs are usually congested visceral congestions is marked in many cases.
What is to he noticed in the present case is that there are hardly ""any cries"" as per the defence also by the deceased.
This is not possible even in case of suicide.
Even if the burns ,ire inflicted with suicidal intent tile victim is bound to cry out of pain.
Admittedly there was no cries and, therefore, it was not a Case of suicidal burn but the deceased was put in a condition where she could not cry and yet get burnt by third party.
As is clear from the aforesaid commentary of Dr. K.S. Narayan Reddy that if it was a case of merely burns the blood of the heart would have got clotted.
Even the postmortem report does not say that asphvsix was due to burn.
Coupled with all the internal injuries which occur in the case of strangulation.
are present in this case.
As pointed out by the High Court there is no direct evidence to connect the appellants with the offence of murder and the prosecution entirely rests its case only on circumstantial evidence.
There is a series of decisions of this Court propounding the cardinal principles to be followed in cases in which the evidence is of circumstantial nature.
It is not necessary to repapitulate all those decisions except stating the essential ingredients as noticed by Pandian, J. in the case reported as The State of Uttar Pradesh vs Dr. Ravindra Prakesh J. in the case 2 SC 114 at 121, to prove quilt of an accused person by circumstantial evidence.
They are: (1) The circumstance from which tile conclusion is drawn should be fully proved; (2) the circumstances should he conclusive in nature; 888 (3)all the facts so established should he consistent only with the hypothesis of guilt and inconsistent with innocence: (4)the circumstances should.
to a moral certainty, exclude the possibility of guilt of any person other than the accused.
"" Now let us examine the impelling circunistances attending the case and examine whether tile cumulative effect of those circumstances negatives tile innocence of tile appellants and serves a definite pointer towards their guilt and unerringly leads to the conclusion that with all human probability the offence was committed by the appellants and none else.
There is no doubt that when the incident occurred there was no outsider its the house.
The circumstances which ire establislied its having closely linked up with one another may be noticed 1) The motive for the occurrence.
2) The place where the tragic incident occurred was in possession and occupation of the appellants.
3) The occurrence had happened in the wee hours when body else would have had ingress at the place where the incident allegedly occurred.
4) The appellants admit their presence.
The positive features, which occurred, had it been it pure case of burning, there would he evidence of vomiting.
6) The positive opinion of the doctor that the death was due to asphysix as well apart from 100% burns.
7) The deceased was carrying fetus of 3 4 months 8) The extensive use of kerosene as seen from the burn shows that the deceased was practically 889 drenched as sort of a bath with kerosene. 9) Total absence of any shout or cries except one which was heard by way o f strangulation by PW.
1. 10) Blood in heart was not found clotted.
Right ventricle heart was full of blood but left ventricle wits empty.
11) Besides total burning of neck was to destroy evidence of attempted strangulation.
12) In burn brain is usually shrunken and firm whereas in strangulation it is congested.
As noticed by Pandian, J. in the aforesaid decision, opinion of Taylor in Medical Jurisprudence is quoted below.
It reads thus: ""Not uncommonly the victim who inhales smoke also vomits and inhales some vomit, presumably due to bouts of coughing, and plugs of regur gitated stomach contents mixed with soot may be found in the smaller bronchi, in the depths of the lungs.
"" By the time a person could take a bath of kerosene she is likely to get fainted and would not be in a position thereafter to burn herself.
A total burning, of the face and the neck shows that even at portions where she was not wearing any clothes were not burnt.
It could only be possible if she had poured kerosene on her head and face also.
It is not understood as to how the unposted post card found near the dead body was not burnt when the whole body had got burnt.
It in fact indicates that the planting of the post card was to show that it was a case of suicidal death.
In passes all human probabilities that the appellants have satisfied themselves by watching through the window the burning of daughter in law without any due and cry or without and serious attempt to save her.
We are thus satisfied that it was a case of murder and not suicidal death.
So far as the accomplicity of appellants 1 and 2 are concerned, there is no doubt.
But 890 it is not necessary if appellant Nos. 3 4 i.e. mother in law and sister in law of the deceased have also participated in the murder of the deceased.
For the aforesaid reasons we dismiss the appeal on behalf of appellant.
Nos. 1 and 2 but give benefit of doubt to appellant Nos. 3 and 4 and accept the appeal on their behalf.
They are accordingly acquitted.
The convictions and sentences of appellant Nos. 1 and 2 are upheld.
U. R. Appeal dismissed.
","Sangita was married to accused 2 on 28th April, 1984.
In the intervening night of 14115 September 1984, the accused found Sangita burning.
Sangita 's body suffered 100% burns and the smell of kerosene was noticed even in the spot panchnama.
There had been problems relating to dowry, and she had complained of ill treatment and of being beaten because of failure to pay the dowry amount.
The trial judge acquitted accused 1 4 her father in law, husband, mother in law and sister in law respectively.
The High Court examined the evidence a fresh, while castigating the trial judge for having gone merely on the statement of the Public Prosecutor that only a case under Ss. 306, 498 A and 34 was made out.
The High Court Convicted the accused under S.302 r/w 34, S.201 r/w 34 and 498 A r/w 34.
Partly dismissing the appeal, this Court.
HELD: 1.
It was a case of murder and not suicidal death.
It is not possible that there were no 'cries ' from the deceased while she was burning.
This is not possible even in a case of suicide.
Some of the symptoms of internal and external injuries are common in 879 case (if strangulation and burns.
But some symptoms that occur in the case of strangulation, and not in case of burns, are present in this case.
Dr. K.S. Narayan Reddy, The Essentials of Forensic Medicine and Toxicology 6th edn.
p. 55, relied on.
The prosecution rests its case only on circumstantial evidence.
Therefore, it is necessary to examine the impelling circumstances attending the case and examine whether the cumulative effect of those circumstances negatives the innocence of the appellant ,; and serves a definite pointer towards their guilt and unerringly leads to the conclusion that with all human probability the offence was committed by the appellants and none else.

applied.
Taylor, Medical jurisprudence, relied on.
On an appreciation of the circumstances which arc established as being closely linked to one another, the complicity of appellants 1 and 2 is not in doubt.
But it is not necessary that appellants 3 and 4 also participated in the murder of the deceased.
They are given the benefit of doubt and accordingly acquitted.
</s>","  This is an appeal by the four accused persons against the judgment of the Bombay High Court dated 16th November, 1992 convicting them under Section 302 read with Section 34 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 (hereinafter referred to as the 'IPC') and sentencing them to imprisonment for life.
The facts leading to the conviction of the accused persons have been set out in detail in the judgment of the High Court and need not be repeated here.
The only question which arises for consideration in this appeal is whether the High Court was justified in convicting the accused persons of the offence of murdering Sangita, the wife of accused No. 2, and treating her with cruelty within the meaning of Section 304B read with Section 34 of the IPC.
Section 304B of the IPC provides that ""Whoever causes the death of any person by doing an act with intent to cause death, or by negligently performing an act which he knows to be likely to cause death, shall be punished with imprisonment for life"".
Section 34 of the IPC provides that ""Whenever any person is guilty of a crime, whoever, knowing or having reason to believe in the existence of such crime, conspires or abets, or counsels or procures or attempts to commit, or threatens to commit any such crime, shall be punished with the punishment provided for the crime so committed"".
The High Court held that the evidence adduced by the prosecution established beyond doubt that the accused persons had caused the death of Sangita by setting fire to her body while she was alive and that they had treated her with cruelty by demanding dowry from her husband and by causing harassment to her.
The High Court further held that the accused persons had acted with common intention and that the offences committed by them fell within the ambit of Section 304B of the IPC.
The High Court also held that the accused persons had abetted the suicide of Sangita by subjecting her to cruelty and that the offence committed by them fell within the ambit of Section 306 of the IPC.

The High Court also acquitted the accused persons of the offence of committing suicide by Sangita under Section 309 of the IPC.

","The decision in the case of Jarnail Singh vs Lachhmi Narain Gupta has significant implications for reservation in promotions for Scheduled Castes (SCs) and Scheduled Tribes (STs). In light of this decision, there are several potential legislative responses that could be considered:

1. Clarifying the criteria for determining inadequacy of representation: The legislature could enact a law that provides clear guidelines on how to determine whether SCs and STs are inadequately represented in promotions. This would help ensure that reservation in promotions is based on objective criteria and avoids any arbitrary or subjective assessments.

2. Collecting and analyzing quantifiable data: The decision emphasizes the importance of collecting quantifiable data to justify reservation in promotions. The legislature could pass a law mandating the collection and analysis of such data on a regular basis. This would provide a more robust basis for implementing reservation policies and help address any concerns regarding the impact on administration efficiency.

3. Reviewing the reservation policy periodically: The legislature could establish a mechanism for periodic review of the reservation policy in promotions. This would allow for an assessment of the effectiveness and impact of the policy, and any necessary adjustments or modifications could be made based on the findings of the review.

4. Ensuring transparency and accountability: The legislature could enact legislation that promotes transparency and accountability in the implementation of reservation in promotions. This could include provisions for regular reporting, monitoring, and evaluation of the policy, as well as mechanisms for addressing any grievances or complaints related to the reservation policy.

5. Promoting diversity and inclusivity: The legislature could consider measures to promote diversity and inclusivity in promotions, beyond reservation policies. This could include initiatives to provide equal opportunities for all employees, regardless of their social background, and to create a more inclusive and equitable work environment.

It is important for the legislature to carefully consider these potential legislative responses in order to strike a balance between promoting social justice and ensuring efficiency and fairness in the promotion process.</s>","   The decision in the case of Jarnail Singh vs Lachhmi Narain Gupta raises several potential legislative responses. Firstly, there could be a need for amendments to the Constitution of India to ensure that reservation policies are based on quantifiable data and not solely on caste or community. This would require the establishment of a robust data collection mechanism to gather accurate information about backwardness and inadequacy of representation among different communities. Secondly, there may be a need for legislation to establish clear guidelines and criteria for determining the extent of reservation in promotions. This would help prevent arbitrary decisions and ensure that reservations are based on valid reasons. Additionally, there could be a requirement for periodic reviews and assessment of the effectiveness of reservation policies to ensure they continue to serve their intended purpose. Furthermore, there might be a need for legislation to address any potential issues arising from the implementation of reservation policies, such as conflicts between different groups or concerns regarding the impact on meritocracy. These legislative responses would aim to strike a balance between affirmative action and equal opportunities while ensuring fairness and inclusivity in the promotion process. It's important to note that these potential legislative responses should be carefully considered and drafted to avoid any unintended consequences and ensure compliance with constitutional provisions.  It's worth mentioning that the specific legislative responses will depend on the political and social context of the country at the time of the decision. However, these potential legislative responses provide a general outline of the steps that could be taken to address the issues raised by the case.  It's also important to note that the decision in this case was based on the interpretation of Article 14 of the Indian Constitution, which guarantees the right to equality before the law. Any legislative responses should be in line with the principles of equality and non-discrimination enshrined in the Constitution.  Overall, the potential legislative responses to the decision in the case of Jarnail Singh vs Lachhmi Narain Gupta highlight the need for careful consideration and reform in the area of reservation policies to ensure their effectiveness and fairness while upholding the principles of equality and non-discrimination."
"<s>[INST] Summarize:Criminal Appeal No. 96 of 1979.
From the Judgment and Order dated 9.11.1977 of the Patna High Court in Criminal Appeal No. 332 of 1971.
Khanna for the Appellants.
D. Goburdhan for the Respondent.
The Judgment of the Court was delivered by FATHIMA BEEVI, J.
This appeal by special leave is di rected against the judgment and order dated 9.11.1977 of the High Court of Patna whereby the conviction and sentences of the appellants for the offences under Sections 302,394 and 34, I .P.C., have been confirmed.
The three appellants are brothers.
The deceased, Bigna Bedia, lived with his wife Sohagia Bedia and sons in village Karmatola.
The incident happened on the night of 5/6.9.
Bigna was sleeping 574 along with his son Jhalku in the verandah while Sohagia was sleeping along with Malku on cot.
At about midnight, the intrud ers entered the house by cutting the tatti and attacked Sohagia and her husband.
Binga Bedia sustained fatal injuries and died instantaneously.
Sohagia was injured.
The intruders took away the utensils and two she goats kept at one end of the verandah.
Jiwan Bedia, the brother of the deceased, on being informed by Jhalku and Lalku about the incident reached the house and after making enquiries, he lodged the first information report at the police station at about 10.00 A.M in the next morning.
The crime was registered against unidentified persons.
In the course of the investigation these appellants were arrested and were finally charge sheeted.
There had been ill feeling between the appellants on the one hand and the deceased and his wife on the other, though the appellants are the sons of the eider sister of Sohagia.
The prosecution case is that on account of enmity, the three appellants committed the crime.
Sohagia claimed to be an eye witness.
According to this witness, the three appellants were armed.
Gurja had a tangi, Birja had a lathi and Mukund had a pharsa.
On entering the house Gurja and Birja dealt blows on Sohagia with the weapons they had.
She got injured and cried.
On hearing the alarm, the deceased was awakened from sleep and when he was trying to get up, all the three appellants left her and killed her husband.
P.W. 14 asserted that Gurja had been flashing a torch and that she had iden tified all the three appellants.
She also stated that she became unconscious and regained consciousness only the next day when the police arrived at the scene.
According to the prosecution, P.W. 14 is the only eye witness.
Lalku and Jhalku who ran to the house of P.W 1 had not seen the as sailants.
The trial court accepted the testimony of P.W. 14 corroborated by the medical evidence and other circumstances as the basis for the conviction.
The High Court agreed with the trial court in holding that the prosecution has succeed ed to bring home the guilt of all the appellants.
The learned counsel for the appellants urged before us that the testimony of P.W. 14 suffers from serious infirmi ties casting reasonable doubt as to the identity of the assailants and the conviction is therefore unwarranted.
The circumstances relied on by the learned counsel is that in the first information report the identity of the accused had not been revealed.
It is argued that if P.W. 14 had identi fied the assailants, it would have been possible for P.W. 1 to disclose the identity of the accused at the time the first information report was lodged and the circumstances are such that the statements 575 of P.W. 14 are inspired and the prosecution has introduced the theory of unconsciousness of P.W. 14 only in an attempt to explain away the lacuna.
To appreciate this contention, it is necessary to scrutinise the first information report in detail.
P.W. 1, Jiwan Bedia, is the full brother of the deceased.
He has been residing in village Jawabera which is at a distance of about half a kilometer from Karmatola.
Lalku and Jhalku reached his house at about midnight and raised hulla that some thieves had entered their house and killed their father and were also killing their mother.
On hearing this, P.W. 1 got up and went to village Jawabera where he informed his gotias about the incident.
Then taking Sawna Bedia, Jhopra Bedia and others along with him he went to the house of Bigna Bedia.
There he did not find any thief.
On entering the house, he found Bigna Bedia lying dead with bleeding injuries on his head and legs.
The wife of Bigna was also injured with a cut injury on her face.
He learnt there from the wife and both the sons of Bigna that 5 or 6 persons had entered the house by cutting the tatti and had inflicted injuries on Bigna and his wife with tangi, bhujali etc.
and they also removed the lock and peg and took away utensils and two she goats from the house.
P.W. 1 then went to the villagers of Karmatola and told them about this incident.
P.W. 1 also contacted the Mukhia of the village Hindebilli and others before going to the police station.
P.W. 1 in narrating the incident in the Fard byan stated that he learnt from the wife and sons of the deceased that 5 or 6 persons had entered the house and committed the crime and details could be furnished by the widow and the sons of the deceased.
P.W. 1, no doubt, in cross examination supported the version of P.W. 14 that Sohagia was lying unconscious when he reached the house at night and she narrated the incident after regaining consciousness the next day when the police reached there.
The statement of P.W. 1 at the earliest point of time belies the truth of what he has deposed before the court.
He had been categoric that he made enquiries with the wife and sons of the deceased before proceeding to the police station and asserted that 5 or 6 unknown persons had committed the crime.
It clearly indicates that an attempt had been made by the prosecution to introduce the case of unconsciousness of P.W. 14 to explain the infirmity.
It may be that P.W. 14 on account of the shock could not have been so eloquent and depressed, but P.W. 1 had been in the house the whole night and he had contacted all the concerned persons and also made enquiries.
The statement in exhibit p. 6 that details would be given by the wife and sons who were present in the house also affirms that he could not gather any 576 useful information regarding the identity of the assailants.
The courts below have failed to appreciate the evidence of P.W. 14 in the correct perspective in the light of the clinching evidence in the case.
The circumstances that the identity of the assailants was unknown until the police arrived at the scene is clear indication that P.W. 14 or her children had not identified the assailants at the time of the occurrence.
It could be that on account of enmity and ill will their suspicion has turned against these appellants and inspired by that suspicion, the investigation had been misdirected.
We do not therefore consider it safe to sustain the conviction when there is reasonable doubt regarding the participation of the appellants.
The benefit of doubt must necessarily go to the appellants.
In the result, the appeal is allowed.
The convictions and sentences are set aside.
The bail bonds shall stand canceled.
P.S.S. Appeal allowed.
","The appellants were convicted for offences under sections 302,394 and 34 IPC.
They were alleged to have entered the house of the deceased at midnight and attacked him and his wife, PW 14, with sharp edged weapons.
He sustained fatal injuries and died instantaneously.
His wife was injured.
Their two sons ran to the house of uncle PW 1, at a distance to inform him of the incident.
They had not seen the assail ants.
By the time PW 1 reached the scene the assailants had fled.
He had been in the house the whole night and contacted all the concerned persons.
In the FIR that he lodged at about 10 a.m. the next morning the assailants were not named.
The prosecution case was that the appellants had commit ted the crime on account of enmity.
PW 14, who claimed to be an eye witness, deposed that she had identified the appel lants.
She also stated that she became unconscious and regained consciousness only the next day when the police arrived.
PW 1 supported her version.
The trial court accepted the testimony of PW 14.
The High Court agreed with it.
In this appeal by special leave, it was contended for the appellants that if PW 14 had identified the assailants, it would have been possible for PW 1 to disclose the identi ty of the accused at the time the first information report was lodged, and that the prosecution had introduced the theory of unconsciousness of PW 14 only in an attempt to explain away the lacuna Allowing the appeal, the Court, HELD: 1.
It is not safe to sustain the conviction when there is 573 reasonable doubt regarding the participation of the appel lants in the crime.
The benefit of doubt must necessarily go to them.
The statement of PW 1 at the earliest point of time belies the truth of what he had deposed before the court.
He had been categoric in the FIR that he had made enquiries with the wife and sons of the deceased before proceeding to the police station and asserted that five or six unknown persons had committed the crime.
He had also stated that details could be furnished by the widow and sons of the deceased.
This affirmed that he could not gather any useful information regarding identity of the assailants.
All the same, in cross examination he supported the version of PW 14 that she was lying unconscious when he reached the house at night and she narrated the incident after regaining con sciousness when the police reached there.
It clearly indi cates that an attempt had been made by the prosecution to introduce the case of unconsciousness of PW 14 to explain the infirmity.
[576F; G] 3.
The circumstance that the identity of the assailants was unknown until the police arrived at the scene showed that PW 14 or her children had not identified the assailants at the time of the occurrence.

Discuss potential legislative responses to the decision in the given case.

","
The decision in the case of University of Madras v. Shantha Bai could potentially lead to several legislative responses to address the issues raised. Here are some potential legislative responses that could be considered:

1. Amendment to Article 15(1): The decision highlighted the need to clarify the scope of Article 15(1) in relation to educational institutions. The legislature could consider amending Article 15(1) to explicitly include state-aided educational institutions within its purview, ensuring that they are subject to the prohibition against discrimination based on sex.

2. Amendment to Article 29(2): The judgment emphasized that the right to admission to educational institutions is governed by Article 29(2) and not Article 15(1). The legislature could consider amending Article 29(2) to explicitly prohibit discrimination based on sex, ensuring equal access to educational institutions for both men and women.

3. Regulations for Affiliated Colleges: The court upheld the University of Madras regulations that restricted the admission of women students in colleges without proper facilities. However, the legislature could consider formulating clear guidelines and regulations for affiliated colleges to ensure that such restrictions are not discriminatory and do not impede access to education for women.

4. Promotion of Gender Equality in Education: The legislature could introduce legislation aimed at promoting gender equality in education. This could include measures such as providing scholarships and financial assistance to encourage the enrollment of women in educational institutions, implementing affirmative action policies to address historical gender disparities, and promoting awareness and sensitization programs to eliminate gender-based discrimination in educational settings.

5. Establishment of Regulatory Bodies: To ensure the effective implementation of regulations and to address any maladministration in educational institutions, the legislature could consider establishing independent regulatory bodies. These bodies would be responsible for monitoring compliance with regulations, addressing complaints, and ensuring that educational institutions provide equal opportunities and facilities for all students, irrespective of their gender.

These potential legislative responses would help address the concerns raised in the case and promote gender equality in education, ensuring that women have equal access to educational opportunities and facilities.</s>","
The decision in the case of M/S.Raju Construction vs The Government Of India raises several potential legislative responses that could be considered by the Indian Parliament. These responses aim to address the issues raised in the case and provide a more comprehensive framework for government contracts and subsidies.

1. Clear Definition of 'Government Contract': One potential response would be to enact a clear definition of 'government contract' in the relevant laws or regulations. This would ensure that there is no ambiguity regarding what constitutes a government contract, thereby preventing disputes over whether certain contracts are covered under the exemption from income tax.

2. Exemption Criteria: Another response could be to specify the criteria for determining when a contract is considered a government contract. This would help in identifying which contracts should be exempted from income tax and which should not. By providing specific guidelines, the legislature can ensure consistency in the application of the law.

3. Transparency and Accountability: To prevent misuse of government funds and ensure transparency, the legislature could introduce measures such as regular audits and reporting requirements for government contractors. This would enable the public to access information about how government funds are being utilized and identify any potential irregularities.

4. Regulatory Framework: A comprehensive regulatory framework could be established to govern government contracts and subsidies. This framework could include provisions related to tendering processes, contract terms, and dispute resolution mechanisms. It would provide a structured approach to awarding government contracts and ensure fairness and accountability.

5. Public Interest Considerations: The legislature could consider incorporating provisions that prioritize public interest in the allocation of government contracts. This could involve setting up an independent body or committee responsible for evaluating bids based on factors such as technical competence, cost-effectiveness, and social impact.

6. Disclosure Requirements: To promote transparency and prevent corruption, the legislature could mandate disclosure requirements for government contractors. This could include disclosing details of their financial dealings, including income tax payments, and ensuring compliance with all applicable laws and regulations.

7. Penalties and Sanctions: To deter misconduct and ensure compliance, the legislature could establish penalties and sanctions for non-compliance with the provisions related to government contracts and subsidies. This could include fines, legal action, and other consequences for individuals or organizations found guilty of violating the law.

These potential legislative responses aim to strengthen the legal framework surrounding government contracts and subsidies, ensuring greater transparency, accountability, and adherence to the principles of natural justice. They would contribute towards maintaining the integrity of the system and preventing abuses of power."

Formulate a potential public interest litigation based on the given case.

","
A potential public interest litigation (PIL) that can be formulated based on the case of Satwant Singh Sawhney vs D. Ramarathnam, Assistant Passport Officer (1967) is to challenge the constitutionality of the passport authorities' unfettered discretion in granting or refusing passports. The PIL can argue that the arbitrary withdrawal or refusal of passports by the authorities violates the fundamental rights of individuals under Articles 14 and 21 of the Constitution of India.

The PIL can seek the following reliefs:
1. Declare that the right to travel abroad is an integral part of personal liberty under Article 21.
2. Declare that the unfettered discretion of the passport authorities in granting or refusing passports violates the right to equality under Article 14.
3. Direct the authorities to establish clear and transparent guidelines for granting or refusing passports, ensuring that the exercise of discretion is not arbitrary or discriminatory.
4. Establish a mechanism for judicial review of passport decisions to safeguard against abuse of power.

It can highlight the importance of ensuring that the passport issuance process is governed by clear rules and regulations, and that the authorities' discretion is exercised in a manner consistent with constitutional principles.

By challenging the constitutionality of the passport authorities' unfettered discretion, the PIL aims to protect the rights of individuals and promote transparency, fairness, and accountability in the passport issuance process. It seeks to establish a legal framework that balances the government's legitimate interests in regulating travel with the fundamental rights of individuals to travel abroad.</s>","  A potential public interest litigation (PIL) that can be formulated based on the case of Miss Lena Khan vs Union Of India & Ors is as follows:

From the Judgment and Order dated 25.1.1988 of the Andhra Pradesh High Court in Election Petition No. 1 of 1985.

842 The Judgment of the Court was delivered by THOMMEN, J.
This appeal by special leave arises from the order of the high Court of Andhra Pradesh dated 25.1.1988 in Election Petition No. 1 of 1985.
The High Court by the impugned order ""set aside the proceedings of counting and the resultant declaration"" made on 28.12.1985 in respect of the election to the Lok Sabha held on 27.12.1984 from 34, Nizamabad Parliamentary Constituency consisting of 7 Assem bly Segments.
The High Court directed the Secretary to the Election Commission to conduct the counting of the votes afresh in the said Constituency from which the appellant was declared elected to the Lok Sabha.
The 1st respondent, M. Narayan Reddy was one of the six candidates who contested the election.
According to the result declared by the Re turning Officer, the appellant secured 2,51,172 votes while the 1st respondent, the election petitioner, secured 2,48,725 votes.
The 1st respondent filed Election Petition under Sections 80 and 81 of the Representation of the People Act, 195 1 (43 of 1951) (hereinafter referred to as the 'Act ') seeking a declaration that the election of the appel lant was void and that the 1st respondent was duly elected from the said Constituency.
The election was challenged by the 1st respondent broad ly on three grounds: 1.
Illegalities and irregularities in the counting of votes.
Impersonation of voters, and 3.
Corrupt practices.
The High Court on the basis of the pleadings of the parties framed 25 issues, of which Issue No. 7 alone is relevant in the present proceeding.
The election was set aside by the High Court solely on the basis of Issue No. 7, the other issues having been either not pressed by the election peti tioner or found against him.
Issue No. 7 reads: ""Whether the Additional Assistant Returning Officers were not authorised to perform the duties and functions of the Returning Officers as alleged by the election petitioner.?"" The pleading in regard to this issue is contained in paragraph 13 of the Election Petition.
It reads: 843 ""Be that as it may, the ""Additional Returning Officers"" in respect of this Parliamentary constituency were not appointed and authorised by the Election Commission to perform the duties and functions of the Returning Officer.
Therefore, every action taken by the said Additional Assistant Returning Officers, including the rejection of doubtful ballot, papers, is absolutely illegal, void and for bidden by law.
Hence, it is a serious irregularity affecting the validity of counting procedure adopted for counting of votes and on this ground alone the petitioner is entitled to inspection of the ballot papers and order for recount.
These irregular ities have taken place during the counting in all the count ing hails numbering 7 in total.
"" This allegation was refuted by the appellant in his written statement.
He contended that the officers were properly appointed and duly authorised.
Among the witnesses who testified on behalf of the appellant in support of his contentions on this issue was R.W. 8, an Under Secretary to the Election Commission.
He produced Exs.
B 22 to B 28 and Exs.
A 86 to A 88 as well as exhibit X 1 containing documents relating to the relevant pro ceedings connected with the appointment of the Additional Assistant Returning Officers.
Certain documents initially produced and sought to be filed by the appellant as addi tional documents were marked as Exs.
C 5 to C 8 at the instance of the election petitioner, the 1st respondent herein.
The controversy under Issue No. 7, as seen above, was whether the Additional Assistant Returning Officers were duly appointed by the Election Commission.
The Court on consideration of the relevant documents held that they were not duly appointed by the Election Commission and that the votes of the 7 Assembly Segments of the said Constituency were liable to be recounted.
The Court accordingly issued directions in that behalf to the Election Commission.
The main contention of the election petitioner, appear ing in person, in the High Court as well as here has been that the officers in question were not duly appointed by the Election Commission, and that their purported exercise of power as Additional Assistant Returning Officers was without authority and in contravention of the relevant legal provi sions.
We see no merit in this contention.
844 The testimony of R.W. 8 and the documents proved by him leave no doubt that the officers in question were duly appointed by the Election Commission.
R.W. 8 says: ""It is true that exhibit A 55 is the copy of the notification issued by the Election Commission of India and as is clear from the document, it was published in the A.P. Gazette.

We have carefully examined the original documents.
We are satisfied that the testimony of R.W. 8 is fully supported by the documents he has referred to.
By exhibit B 23 dated 14.11.1984 (see page 81 of exhibit X 1) the Chief Electoral Officer, Andhra Pradesh wrote to the Secretary to the Election Commission enclosing a revised list of officers proposed for appointment as Addi tional Assistant Returning Officers for all the 42 Parlia mentary Constituencies for the purpose of counting of votes etc.
and requesting for the approval of the list by the Election Commission.
The revised list at page 137 of exhibit X 1 contains the names of the officers for 34, Nizamabad Parlia mentary Constituency.
By exhibit B 25 dated 18.11.1984 (see pages 1 2 of exhibit X 1) the list was approved by Shri K. Gane shan, the Secretary to the Election Commission.
His signa ture dated 18.11.1984 appears at page 2 of exhibit X 1.
That was an approval of the note dated 18.11.1984 put up by Shri S.R. Sethi, the Under Secretary to the Election Commission, reading ""C.E.O. 's proposals at section Nos. 7 and 8 above and the action suggested at 'A ' above may be approved.
"" It is thus clear that the proposal made by the Chief Election Officer and the revised list submitted by him received the approval of the Secretary to the Election Commission.
It has to be noticed in this connection that Section 19A of the Act empowers the Secretary to the Election Commission to per form, subject to certain 846 conditions, the functions of the Election Commission under the Constitution and relevant statutes and rules.
The Secre tary is, therefore, competent to give approval to the re vised list containing the names of officers proposed by the Chief Electoral Officer.
This fact of approval was duly communicated by the Secretary to the Election Commission to the Chief Electoral Officer, Andhra Pradesh by telex message sent on 19.11.1984 (see exhibit B 22 at page 158 of exhibit X 1).
It was clarified in exhibit B 22 that the notification of the Election Commission was not published in the Gazette of India and it was not required to be published in the State Gazette.
The notification of the Election Commission was sent with the post copy of the telex message.
exhibit B 24 dated 9.11.1984 which is the post copy authenticated by Shri S.R. Sethi, the Under Secretary to the Election Commission is that notification (see pages 156 157 of exhibit X 1).
It says that ""In exercise of the powers conferred by sub section (1) of section 22 of the Representation of the People Act, 195 1 (43 of 195 1), the Election Commission hereby appoints . . "".
A list of the Assistant Returning Officers appointed under the notification is appointed in the table to exhibit B 24, and it begins with ""Srikakulam Par liamentary Constituency"".
The names of the constituencies and the officers are mentioned in the order in which they are stated by the Chief Electoral Officer in his revised list appended to exhibit B 23.
However, exhibit B 24 specifically mentions only Srikakulam Parliamentary Constituency.
At the end of the names in respect of that Constituency, the Under Secretary authenticating the notification merely says ""please see pp 82 157"".
These are the pages of exhibit X 1 containing the entire revised list.
By this device the entire list appended to exhibit B 23 was incorporated into exhibit 24 notification, and the need for typing out all the names in exhibit B 24 was thus avoided.
exhibit B 26 dated 30.11.1984 (see pages 177 179 of exhibit X 1) is a notification issued by the Election Commission making certain amendments to its earlier notification dated 19.11.1984.
Serial No. 17 of exhibit B 26 (at page 178 of exhibit X 1) reads: ""At section No. 13 against item No. 34 Nizamabad, the entry ""13.
District Manager, A.P.S.C.S.C. Nizamabad"" shall be substi tuted;"" This shows that the amendment in respect of 34, Nizamabad Parliamentary Constituency made by exhibit B 26 by substituting entry 17 for the relevant entry in the revised list appended to exhibit B 23 was in affirmation of the incorporation of the entire revised list in exhibit B 24.
In the light of this evidence, there is no merit in the contention 847 that the revised list was not approved by the Secretary to the Election Commission and that the notification evidenced by exhibit B 24 did not relate to 34, Nizamabad Parliamentary Constituency.
As stated earlier, exhibit B 25 evidences the approval given by the Secretary to the Election Commission to the revised list proposed by the Chief Electoral Officer and the approval was duly notified and communicated by the Under Secretary to the Election Commission to the Chief Electoral Officer, Andhra Pradesh with a request to exhibit the notification on the notice boards of the offices of the concerned District Election Officers and Returning Officers.
In this connection, it may be noticed that Under Secre taries are duly authorised to authenticate all orders, notifications and Other instruments on behalf of the Elec tion Commission (see notification No. 226/5/58 of Gazette of India dated 5.4.
1958 appended to Volume I of Paper Book page 170).
In the circumstances, we see no merit in the contention of the election petitioner, the 1st respondent herein, that the concerned officers for the Parliamentary Constituency in question had not been duly appointed by the competent au thority and that they were, therefore, not authorised to perform the duties and functions of the Assistant Returning Officers.
These Officers were appointed by the Secretary to the Election Commission who is undoubtedly to a competent authority to make such appointments and his order appointing them had been duly notified to the Chief Electoral Officer by communicating the same by an officer who was competent to authenticate such orders.
The notification was directed to be exhibited on the notice boards of the concerned offices.
No statutory provision has been brought to our notice re quiring formal publication of such notification in an Offi cial Gazette.
Publication of the notification by exhibition on the notice boards was, in our view, sufficient notice to all persons concerned.
Accordingly, we hold that the High Court was not justi fied in setting aside the proceeding of counting of votes and the resultant declaration and in ordering a fresh count ing of votes in respect of the election from the Parliamen tary Constituency in question.
Consequently, we set aside the impugned order of the High Court insofar as it relates to the findings and directions regarding Issue No. 7.
The appeal is allowed in the above terms.
In the circumstances of this case, we make no order as to costs.
G.N. Appeal al lowed.
","In the Lok Sabha elections held in 1984, the appellant was declared elected from the Nizamabad Parliamentary Constitu ency.
He .secured 2,51,172 votes, while Respondent No. 1 got 2,48,725 votes.
An election petition under Sections 80 and 81 of the Act was filed in the High Court, by the First Respondent; challenging the election of the appellant on grounds of illegalities and irregularities in the counting of votes, impersonation of voters and corrupt practices.
The High Court set aside the election only on one ground that is, the Additional Returning Officers in respect of the Nizamabad Parliament Constituency were not appointed and authorised by the Election Commission to perform the duties and functions of Returning Officers and every action taken by such officers, including the rejection of doubtful ballot papers, is absolutely illegal, void and forbidden by law.
The High Court gave directions to the Election Commission for recounting.
This appeal, by special leave, is against the High Court 's order setting aside the election.
On behalf of the appellant, it was contended that the officers were duly appointed and authorised by the Election Commission.
The First Respondent contended that the officers were not duly appointed by the Election Commission and that their purported exercise of power as Additional Assistant Returning Officers was without authority and in contraven tion of the relevant legal provisions.
Allowing the appeal, 841 HELD: 1.1.
Under Section 19A of the Act, the Secretary to the Election Commission is empowered to perform the functions of the Election Commission under the Constitution, relevant statutes and the rules.

The High Court was not justified in setting aside the proceeding of counting of votes and the resultant declara tion and in ordering a fresh counting of votes in respect of the election from the Parliamentary Constituency in ques tion.
The order of the High Court in so far as it relates to the findings and directions in this regard is set aside.
[847G]
</s>","  This appeal by special leave arises from the order of the high Court of Andhra Pradesh dated 25.1.1988 in Election Petition No. 1 of 1985.
The High Court by the impugned order'set aside the proceedings of counting and the resultant declaration' made on 28.12.1985 in respect of the election to the Lok Sabha held on 27.12.1984 from 34, Nizamabad Parliamentary Constituency consisting of 7 Assembly segments.
The High Court directed the Secretary to the Election Commission to conduct the counting of the votes afresh in the said Constituency from which the appellant was declared elected to the Lok Sabha.
The 1st respondent, M. Narayan Reddy was one of the six candidates who contested the election.
According to the result declared by the Returning Officer, the appellant secured 2,51,172 votes while the 1st respondent, the election petitioner, secured 2,48,725 votes.
The 1st respondent filed Election Petition under Sections 80 and 81 of the Representation of the People Act, 1951 (43 of 1951) (hereinafter referred to as the 'Act ') seeking a declaration that the election of the appellant was void and that the 1st respondent was duly elected from the said Constituency.
The election was challenged by the 1st respondent broadly on three grounds: 1.
Illegalities and irregularities in the counting of votes.
Impersonation of voters, and 3.
Corrupt practices.
The High Court on the basis of the pleadings of the parties framed 25 issues, of which Issue No. 7 alone is relevant in the present proceeding.
The election was set aside by the High Court solely on the basis of Issue No. 7, the other issues having been either not pressed by the election petitioner or found against him.
Issue No. 7 reads: 'Whether the Additional Assistant Returning Officers were not authorised to perform the duties and functions of the Returning Officers as alleged by the election petitioner?' The pleading in regard to this issue is contained in paragraph 13 of the Election Petition.
It reads: 'Be that as it may, the 'Additional Returning Officers' in respect of this Parliamentary constituency were not appointed and authorised by the Election Commission to perform the duties and functions of the Returning Officer.
Therefore, every action taken by the said Additional Assistant Returning Officers, including the rejection of doubtful ballot papers, is absolutely illegal, void and forbidden by law.
Hence, it is a serious irregularity affecting the validity of counting procedure adopted for counting of votes and on this ground alone the petitioner is entitled to inspection of the ballot papers and order for recount.
These irregularities have taken place during the counting in all the counting halls numbering 7 in total.' This allegation was refuted by the appellant in his written statement.
He contended that the officers were properly appointed and duly authorised.
Among the witnesses who testified on behalf of the appellant in support of his contentions on this issue was R.W. 8, an Under Secretary to the Election Commission.
He produced Exs.
B 22 to B 28 and Exs.

The court below rejected the evidence of R.W. 8 and held that the Additional Assistant Returning Officers were not authorised to perform the duties and functions of the Returning Officer.
On the basis of this finding, the High Court set aside the election of the appellant and directed the Secretary to the Election Commission to conduct the counting of the votes afresh in the said Constituency from which the appellant was declared elected to the Lok Sabha.

6. Continuously monitor and assess the client's operations to identify potential legal risks and take proactive measures to mitigate them. This may involve engaging legal counsel on a regular basis to provide guidance and advice.

7. Consider establishing a mediation or arbitration mechanism to resolve disputes amicably. This can help reduce the likelihood of lengthy and costly litigation and promote efficient dispute resolution.

8. Stay up-to-date with changes in the law and legal developments related to the client's industry or sector. This will enable the client to adapt and respond effectively to any new legal challenges or opportunities.

9. Foster a culture of compliance and ethical business practices within the client's organization. This can include providing training and education programs for employees, promoting a code of conduct, and implementing internal controls and procedures to ensure adherence to legal requirements.

10. Regularly review and update the client's legal documents, such as contracts, agreements, and policies, to reflect any changes in the law or the client's operations. This will help maintain the validity and enforceability of these documents and minimize the risk of legal disputes.

By following this potential legal strategy, the client can take proactive steps to avoid a similar issue as in the given case and protect their interests while operating within the bounds of the law. However, it is important to note that the effectiveness of this strategy depends on various factors, including the specific circumstances of the client and the evolving nature of the law. Therefore, it is crucial to consult with experienced legal professionals to tailor the strategy according to the client's unique needs and circumstances."

Under el. 8 of the Bill foot wear were proposed to be taxed at 10% advaloram if produced in any factory as defined in the factories Act, 1948 (63 of 1948).
When the Finance Act, 1954 (17 of 1954) was enacted, the Central Excises and Salt Act, 1954, was amended by the inclusion of item 17 in the Schedule, though in a slightly different form.
The item as finally enacted read as follows: 644 ""17.
FOOTWEAR, produced in any factory including the precints thereof whereon fifty or more workers are working or were working on any day, of the preceding twelve months, and in any part of which manufacturing process is being carried on with the aid of power or is ordinarily so carried on, the total equivalent of such power exceeding two horse power.
""Footwear"" includes all varieties of footwear,whether known boots shoes, sandals, chappals, or by any other name."" {Ten percent ""advalorem""} Under the provisions of the , (XVIof 1931), the duty was leviable from February 28, 1954, by virtue of a declaration in the Bill to that effect.
On the preceding day the Superintendent of Central Excise., Kanpur, deputed an Inspector of his department to obtain from the petitioner a declaration of all stock of footwear and requested that the Inspector be permitted to verify the stocks with a view to levying the Excise Duty on and from February 28, 1954.
As a ' result of the position of Excise Duty on footwear the petitioner was required to pay during the remaining ten months of 1954 a sum of RE;.
9,47,630/ as Excise Duty.
The petitioner produces in the two units above named, footwear for sale to the public and for supplies to the Government for the use of the Army and the Police.
The petitioner contends that though the Excise Duty paid by it was capable of being passed on to the consumer, it could not include it in the price at which shoes were sold to the public because of heavy competition by those free from such duty , though it did include the Excise Duty in the price of the footwear supplied to Government.
Thus Rs. 2 lacs odd were passed on to Government but Rs. 7 lacs odd were born 645 by the Company itself.
The petitioner contended before the Collector of Central Excise, Allahabad, that the calculation of the duty advalorem should not be, based on price including freight, packing and distribution charges paid to it, by its distributors in the outlying parts of India.
This contention of the petitioner was not accepted by the Collector.
The petitioner then took an appeal to the Central Board of Revenue but before the appeal could be disposed of, the petitioner filed this petition under Art, 32 of the Constitution praying for writ or writs to quash the order of the Collector of Central Excise, Allahabad, and writ or writs to prohibit Union Government.
The Central Board of Revenue and the Collector and Superintendent of Central Excise from enforcing the provisions of item 17 against petitioner and collecting the Excise Duty therein levied.
According to the petitioner, a distinction has been made in Item 17 above quoted between manufacturers of footwear employing more than 50 workers .or carrying on the manufacturing process with the aid of power exceeding 2 H.P. and other manufacturers.
According to the petitioner this amounts to discrimination because there is no reasonable basis for differentiating between manufacturers on the basis of number of workers or the employment of power above 2 H.P.
The petitioner contends that the essentials of the manufacture of footwear are the same whether one employs 50 or more workers or less.
The larger number of workers is merely needed because the out turn has to be greater but the number does not change the nature of the operations or the method of production.
Similarly, the need for than 2 H.P. arises if a larger number of mechanical units have to be worked and there is no essential difference between a large manufacturer 646 and a small manufacturer by reason of the employment of more power or less.
It is, therefore, contended that the imposition of Excise Duty on bigger manufacturers creates a discrimination in the trade which is neither just nor discernible and amounts to a violation of article 14 of the Constitution.
The levy of the Excise Duty in such circumstances is said to be both illegal and unconstitutional.
As a corrolary to this it is contended that the petitioner, which was already carrying on its business at a loss in view of the competition, is now further handicapped by having to bear a heavy Excise Duty which it cannot pass on to the consumer due to competition by those not paying the duty and is likely to go out of its business and that the levy of the Excise Duty in these circumstances amounts to a breach also of Art . 19 (1) (f) and (g) and 31 of the Constitution.
It is further contended that the duty advalorem ought to be calculated on the ex factory price and not on the price charged to the distributors which includes within itself the cost of packing and charges for freight and distribution commission.
It is contended that this is an error apparent on the face of the order of the Collector of Excise and the order deserves to be quashed by the issue of ' writ of certiorari or other appropriate writ.
Lastly, it is contended that the Finance Act, 1954 received the assent of the president on April 27, 1954, and must be deemed to have become law ,from that date.
The collection of Excise Duty from March, 1954, before the Finance Bill became law, is said to be illegal.
We shall deal only brie fly with these arguments as most of them have by now been considered and decided in other cases of this Court.
647 The contention that this duty does not amount to a duty of excise because it cannot be passed on by the petitioner to the consumer was not raised before us.
It was mentioned in the petition.
An Excise Duty is a duty on production and though according to the economists, it is an indirect tax capable of being passed on to the consumer as part of the price yet the mere passing on of the duty is not its essential Even if borne.
by the producer characteristic.
or manufacturer it does not cease to be a duty of excise.
The nature of such a duty was explained in the very first case of the Federal Court and subsequently in others of the Federal Court, the Privy Council and this Court, but this ground continues to be taken and we are surprised that it was raised again.
The contentions that the duty could not be collected before the passing of the Finance Act, 1954, has been the subject of an elaborate discussion in the recently decided case of this Court, M/s. Chotabhai Jethabhai Patel and Co. vs Union of India (1).
It is conceded that in view of the above decision the point is no longer open.
It is also conceded that the question whether in calculating the duty advalorem, the Collector of Excise was justified in including in the price the cost of packing, charges for freight and commission for distribution, or not, is a matter for the decision of the authorities constituted under the Act subject to such appeals and revisions as might lie but not a matter for consideration directly under article 32 of the constitution, in view of the recent decision of this Court in Smt.
Ujjam Bai vs State of U.P. (Civil Misc.
Petition No. 79 of 1959) decided on April 10, 1962.
It may be pointed out that the present petition was filed at a time when the appeal before the (1) (1962) Supp. 2 S.C.R. 1.
648 Board of Revenue was pending and there was a further right of revision to the Central Government.
This leaves over for consideration true challenge under article 14, 19 and 31 of the constitution.
The argument under each of these Articles is based on precisely the same facts viewed from different angles.
It is.
contended that there is a discrimination between big manufacturers of footwear and small manufacturers which is not based on any differential.
This discrimination, it is said, leads to the imposition of a heavy tax on the big manufacturers with a corresponding exemption in favour of the small manufacturers giving rise to a competition sufficient to put the big manufacturers out of the market.
The tax being illegal the levy amounts to a confiscation of the property of the petitioner.
It will thus be seen that the imposition of the duty is first challenged article 14 as a discrimination, next it is challenged under Article 19 as a deprivation of the right to acquire, hold and dispose of property or to carry on a business or trade and lastly the collection 'of duty is characterised as a confiscation of property without the authority of law under article 31.
The argument suffers from a fundamental fallacy in that it assumes that there can be no classification of manufacturers on the basis of the number of workers or the employment of power above a particular horse power.
Manufacturers who employ 50 or more workers can be said to form a well defined class.
Manufacturers whose manufacturing process is being carried on with the aid of power exceeding 2 H.P. are also a well defined class.
Legislation of this type depending upon the number of workers or the extent of power employed, is frequently to be found.
The most obvious example is the Factories Act which defines a factory with reference to the employment of a certain number of 649 workers or the employment of power.
The contention that size makes no difference is not valid.
It is well known that the bigger manufacturers are able to effect economics in their manufacturing process and their out turn being both large and rapid they are able to undersell am all manufacturers.
If this were not so mass production would lose all its advantages.
No doubt the manufacturers are now required to bear burdens which previously did not exist, like bonus, expenses on labour welfare etc.
but still the manufacturers, provided the business is well ran, can by mass production offer the same commodity at a competitive price as against small ' manufacturers and bear the burden as well.
Therefore, in imposing the Excise Duty, there was a definite desire to make an exemption in favour of the small manufacturer who is unable to pay the duty as easily, if at all, as the big manufacturer.
Such a classification in the interests of co operative societies, cottage industries and small manufacturers has often to be made to give an Impetus to them and save them from annihilation in competition with large industry.
It has never been successfully assailed on the ground of discrimination.
Recently, this Court in the Orient Weaving Mills (P) Ltd. vs The Union of India(1) considered a similar argument in relation to an exemption granted to societies working a few looms on co operative basis as against big companies working hundreds of looms.
exemption was held to be constitutional and the classification of co operative societies was held to be reasonable.
A similar consideration applies in the present case, where the exemption operates in respect of very small manufacturers employing not more than 50 workers and carrying on their manufacturing process with power not in excess of 2 H.P. This affords a protection to small concerns who, if they were made to pay the duty, would have to go out of business.
(1) (1962) Supp.
3 S.C.R. 481.
650 In our judgment the Schedule which is characterised as discriminative is based upon a reasonable classification and is validly enacted.
If the law is held to be valid the attack under articles 19 and 31 must also fail.
In view of what we have said above the petition must fail.
It will be dismissed with costs.
Petition dismissed.
","Under item No.17 of the Schedule to the , excise duty was levied on footwear produced in any factory employing 50 or more workmen and using power exceeding 2 H.P.
The petitioner contended that the imposition of duty on larger manufacturers only was dis criminatory and there was no reasonable basis for differentiating between manufacturers on the basis of number of workers or the employment of power above 2 H.P. and that the im. position of the heavy duty gave rise to a competition sufficient to put the big manufacturers out of business.
Held, that item 17 of the Schedule is based upon a reasonable classification and is validly enacted.
Manufacturers who employed 50 or more workers form a well defined class, so also manufacturers who.
use power exceeding 2 H.P.
In imposing the excise duty there is a definite desire to make an exemption in favoui of the small manufacturer who is unable to pay the duty as easily, if at all, as the big manufacturer, Such a classification in the interests of co operative societies cottage industries and small 'manufacturers has often the made to give an impetus to them and save them from annihilation in competition with large industry.

</s>","  The petitioner, the British India Corporation Ltd., is a public limited company which was formed to take over other companies and to amalgamate them.
Among the companies which the petitioner took over were Cooper Allan & Co. Ltd., and the North West Tannery Co. Ltd., both of Kanpur.

Appeal by special leave from the judgment and decree dated March 24, 1952, of the Judicial Commissioner 's Court, Vindhya Pradesh, in First Appeal No. 16 of 1952.
L.K. Jha, A. D. Mathur and R. Patnaik, for the appellant.
N.C. Chatterjee, and D. N. Mukherjee, for respondent No. 1. 1961.
March 16.
The Judgment of P. B. Gajendragadkar, K. Subba Rao, K. N. Wanchoo and J. R. Mudholkar, JJ., was delivered by Mudholkar, J. A. K. Sarkar, J., delivered a separate Judgment, MUDHOLKAR, J. This is an appeal by Special leave and the main point involved in it is whether the Rewa State Pre emption Act, 1949, is unconstitutional on the 360 ground that it places an unreasonable restriction upon the right to acquire property enumerated in cl.
(1)(f) of article 19 of the Constitution.
But before we hear arguments upon this point it is necessary to dispose of the preliminary objection raised on behalf of ' the plaintiff respondent No. 1 by Mr. N. C. Chatterjee to the effect that the defendant appellant is precluded from proceeding with the appeal because subsequent to the grant.
of special leave to appeal, to him he withdrew the price of pre emption which was deposited by the respondent No. 1 in the court below.
He contends that by withdrawing the pre emption price the appellant must be deemed to have accepted the decree which alone entitled him to the amount and that, therefore, he cannot be heard to say that the decree is erroneous.
In short, Mr. Chatterjee relies upon the doctrine that a person cannot be allowed to approbate and reprobate.
In support of his contention, learned counsel has relied upon the well known case of Tinkler vs Hilder (1) and other cases which follow that decision or which proceed on the same reason as that in Tinkler 's case (1).
Those decisons are: Banku Chandra Bose vs Marium Begum ( 'a); Ramendramohan Tagore vs Keshabchandra Chanda (2); Mani Ram vs Beharidas (3); section K. Veeraswami Pillai vs Kalyanasundaram Mudaliar & Ors.
(4); Venkatarayudu vs Chinna (5) and Pearce vs Chaplin (6).
The two English decisions just referred to and some of the Indian decisions were considered in Venkata.
rayudu vs Chinna (5).
Dealing with them Venkatasubba Rao, J., observed as follows: ""What is the principle underlying these decisions When an order shows plainly that it is intended to take effect in its entirety and that several parts of it depend upon each other, a person cannot adopt one part and repudiate another.
For instance, if the Court directs that the suit shall be restored on the plaintiff paying the costs of the opposing party, (1) ; (2) Cal.
(4) A.I.R. 1927 Mad. 1009.
(1a) (1915] (3) A.I.R. 1955 Raj.
(5) (6) ; [1846] 9 Q.B. 802: 361 there is no intention to benefit the latter, except on the terms mentioned in the order itself.
If the party receives the costs, his act is tantamount to adopting the order. .
According to Halsbury this rule is an application of the doctrine ""that a person may not approbate and reprobate"" (13 Halsbury, para 508). . . .
In other words,to allow a party, who takes a benefit under such an order, to, complain against it, would be to permit a breach of faith"".
The view taken in the other cases proceeds on similar reasoning But what has to be noted is that in all these cases the benefit conferred by the order was something apart from the merits of the claim in, volved in these cases.
What we are called upon to decide is whether the appellant by withdrawing the pre emption price can be said to have adopted the decree from which he had already preferred an appeal.
The appellant did not seek to execute the decree, and indeed the decree did not confer a right upon him to sue out execution at all.
The decree merely conferred a right upon the plaintiff respondent No. 1 to deposit the price of pre emption and upon his doing so, entitled him to be substituted in the sale deed in place of the vendee.
The act of the appellant in withdrawing the pre emption price after it was deposited by the respondent No. 1 cannot clearly amount to, an adoption by him of the decree which he had specifically challenged in his appeal.
Upon the principles underlying the aforesaid decisions a person who takes benefit under an order de hors the claim on merits cannot repudiate that part of the order which is detrimental to him because the order is to take effect in its entirety.
How can it be said that a vendee in a pre emption suit against whom a decree is passed takes any ""benefit"" thereunder? No doubt, he has a right to be paid the pre emption price before the pre emption decree becomes effective but tile price of pre emption cannot be characterised as a benefit under the decree.
It is only in the nature of compensation to the vendee for the loss of his property.
46 362 For this reason the principle of the aforesaid decision would not apply to such a decree.
A question similar to the one before us had arisen in the Punjab in several cases and in particular in the judgment of Lal Chand, J., in Sundara Das vs Dhanpat Rai (1).
What the court held there is that the right of appeal is not forfeited by the vendee merely because he has withdrawn the money deposited by the preemptor in whose favour a decree for pre emption has been passed.
No reference is made by the learned judge to the decisions in Tinkler 's case (2) and in Pearce 's, case (3) and, therefore, this decision and other similar decisions are of little assistance in considering the ""argument advanced by Mr. Chatterjee.
It seems to us however, that in the absence of some statutory provision or of a well recognised principle of equity, no one can be deprived of his legal rights including a statutory right of appeal.
The phrase ""approbate and reprobate"" is borrowed from Scotch Law where it is used to expres the principle embodied in the English doctrine of election, namely, that no party can accept and reject the same instrument (per Scrutton, L. J., in Verschures Creameries vs Hull and Netherlands Steamship.
, Co.,(4).
The House of Lords further pointed out in Lissenden vs C. A. V. Bosch, Ltd. (5) that the equitable doctrine of election applies only when an interest is conferred as an act of bounty by some instrument.
In that case they held that the withdrawal by a workman of the compensation money deposited by the employer could not take away the statutory, right of appeal conferred upon him by the Workmen 's Compensation Act.
Lord Maugham, after pointing out the limitations of the doctrine of approbate and reprobate observed towards the conclusion of his speech: ""It certainly cannot be suggested that the receipt of the sum tendered in any way injured the respondents.
Neither estoppel nor release in the ordinary sense was suggested.
Nothing was less served than (1) (1907] P. R. No. 16.
(2) ; (3) ; (1846) 9 Q.B. 802: (4) (5) [1940] A.C 412.
363 the principles either of equity or of justice."" (pp. 421 422).
Lord Wright agreed with Lord Maugham and Lord Atkin and declined to apply the ""formula"" to the appeal before the House because there was no question of the appellant having alternative or mutually exercisable right to choose from.
No doubt, as pointed out by Lord At that in a conceivable case the receipt of a remedy under a judgment may be made in such circumstances as to preclude an appeal.
But he did not think it necessary to discuss in what circumstance the statutory right of appeal may be lost and added: ""I only venture to say that when such cases have to be considered it may be found difficult to apply this doctrine of election to cases where the only right in existence is that determined by the judgment: and the only conflicting right is the statutory right to seek to set aside or amend that judgment: and that the true solution may be found in the words of Lord Blanesburgh in Moore vs Cunard Steamship Co. (1)"".
According to Lord Blanesburgh when an order appealed against and later set aside, has been acted upon in the meantime ""any mischief so done is undone"" by an appropriate order.
Thus the only question which has to be considered is whether the party appealing has so conducted himself as to make restitution impossible or inequitable.
Thus, according to the House of Lords it is to cases in which a party has so conducted himself as to make restitution impossible or inequitable that the principle on which the decision in Tinkler 's case (2), is.
based, may apply.
Referring to this case and three other similar cases Lord Atkin observed: ""In any case they form very flimsy foundation for such a wide reaching principle applicable to all appeals Its was asserted in this case: and if they did lead to that result should not be followed.
428 429).
(3) The Lissenden case has thus in clear terms (1) (2)(1849) 4 Ex 187; ; (3) 364 indicated what the limitations of the Scotch doctrine are.
If, therefore, what was laid down in this case is the common law of England according to its highest judicial tribunal, it is only that law which the courts in this country may apply on the principles of natural justice and not what was supposed to be the common law in certain earlier decisions.
It seems to us that a statutory right of appeal cannot be presumed to have come to an end because the appellant has in the meantime abided by or taken advantage of something done by the opponent under the decree and there is no justification for extending the rule in Tinkler 's case (1) to cases like the present.
In our judgment it must be limited only to those cases where a person has elected to take a benefit otherwise than on the merits of the claim in the lis under an order to which benefit he could not have been entitled except for the order.
Here the appellant, by withdrawing the preemption price has not taken a benefit de hors the merits.
Besides, this is not a case where restitu tion is impossible or inequitable.
Further. it seems to us that the existence of a choice between two rights is also one of the conditions necessary for the applicability of the doctrine of approbate and reprobate.
In the case before us there was no such choice before the appellant and, therefore, his act in withdrawing the preemption price cannot preclude him for continuing his appeal.
We., therefore, overrule the preliminary objection.
The appeal will now be set down for hearing on merits.
The costs of this hearing will be costs in the appeal.
SARKAR, J.
It seems to me that the objection to the maintainability of this appeal must succeed.
The appellant having taken the benefit of the decree cannot now challenge its validity.
The decree was passed in a suit for preemption brought in May, 1951 by the respondent Baijnath, whom I will call the respondent.
against the appellant, the purchaser of certain property and the vendors, the other respondents who have not appeared in this appeal.
The suit was dismissed by the trial Court but (1) ; 365 on appeal it was decreed by the Judicial Commissioner Vindhya Pradesh, on March 24,1952.
The learned Judicial Commissioner held that the respondent had the right of pre emption and that the purchase money payable by him to the appellant for preemption of the property, *as Rs. 3,000 and directed the respondent to pay this sum into court within four months.
The respondent duly paid this sum into court.
The appellant obtained special, leave from this Court to appeal from the judgment of the learned Judicial Commissioner and thereafter withdrew from court the amount paid in by the respondent.
The present appeal arises under this leave.
The decree that was drawn up only stated that the appeal was allowed with costs and the period of grace was four months.
In view of Or.
XX, r. 14, of the Code of Civil Procedure, the decree, in spite of its informality, must be understood as providing that upon the respondent paying the amount found payable as purchase money into court within the time fixed, the appellant would deliver possession of the property to him and his title to it would be deemed to have accrued from the date of the payment into court and that, in default of such payment the suit would stand dismissed with costs.
Now, there is not the slightest doubt that in with.
drawing the money from court the appellant had acted entirely on his free choice; he had in no way been compelled to do so, nor been induced thereto by any act of the respondent.
The respondent had done nothing to put the decree in execution and obtain possession of the property from the appellant.
The appellant need not have withdrawn the money if he so liked and that would not in the least have prejudiced his interest.
He has all along been in possession of the property since he purchased it on June 7, 1950 and he has been in enjoymeint of the money also sine( he withdrew it from court on November 14, 1953.
It seems to me that on these facts the appellant cannot proceed with the appeal.
He cannot be permitted to pursue inconsistent courses of conduct.
By withdrawing the money, he has of his free choice, 366 adopted the decree and must, therefore, be precluded from challenging its validity.
He had no right to the money excepting such as the decree gave him.
Having exercised that right he cannot be heard to say that the decree was invalid and, therefore, the right which he had exercised, had never existed.
The rule is well established in England as well as in our country, that a litigant is not permitted such inconsistent courses of conduct and, so far as I am aware, never been departed from.
As early as 1849 in Tinkler vs Hilder (1), Pollock, C. B., in dealing with a rule to set aside an order said, ""It might be discharged simply on this narrow ground, that, under the circumstances of this case, the party applying to set aside the order in question in point of fact has adopted it by taking something under it"".
In King vs Simmonds (2) and Pearce vs Chaplin (3) the same line of reasoning was adopted.
It is true that in these cases the orders were said to have been adopted because costs, for the payment of which they had provided, had been received.
It is also true that the orders were not such to which the parties directed to pay the costs, were entitled as a matter of right.
But all these do not seem to me to make any difference.
The question is, are the circumstances such that it would be inconsistent conduct to accept a benefit under an order and then to challenge it? I should suppose that for this purpose costs are as much benefit as anything else given by the order.
Likewise when the orders were discretionary or such to which there was no right ex debito justitiae, there would be no reason to say that there could be no inconsistency if they were challenged after benefits under them had been accepted.
For deciding such inconsistency, I am unable to discover that the discretionary nature of the order has any materiality.
Coming to more recent times, we get the case of Dexters Ld.
vs Hill Crest Oil Co. Ld.
There a person, who had taken money under an award made in a commercial arbitration in accordance with which a (1) ; (3) (1846) 9 Q B 802.
(2) ; (4) [1926] 1 K.B 348. 367 judgment had been entered in a special case stated to court, was held precluded from appealing from that judgment.
This, it will be noticed, was not a case where an order was considered to have been adopted because of receipt of costs given by it but because of the receipt of the sum of money which was claimed and which was given by the award.
Scrutton, L. J., observed, (p. 358) ""It startles me to hear it argued that a person can say the judgment is wrong and at the same time accept payment under the judgment as being right"".
I will conclude the reference to the English authorities by reading what Lord Russel of Killowen said in Evans vs Bartlam (1), ""a man having accepted a benefit given him by a judgment cannot allege the invalidity of the judgment which conferred the benefit"".
Of the cases on the point in our country I may refer to Manilal Guzrati vs Harendra Lal (2), Banku Chandra Bose vs Marium Begum (3), Humrybux Deora vs Johurmull Bhotoria (4) and Venkatarayudu vs Chinna (5).
Hurrybux Deora 's case (4) was an appeal from a decree in a suit for the redemption of a mortgage.
The plaintiff had accepted the amount found by the decree passed by the trial Court to be due to him from the mortgagee in possession and receipt of the income of the mortgaged property, and had thereafter filed the appeal asking that he was entitled to more.
Rankin, C. J., who delivered the judgment of the Court, held that there was no inconsistency in the conduct of the appellant and the rule 1 had so long been discussing had, therefore, no application.
This was plainly right.
The appellant had accepted the decree passed and in the appeal did not challenge its correctness so far as it went but only contended that it had not gone far enough.
As has been said, he was not blowing hot and cold but only blowing hotter: see per Greer, L.J., in Mills vs Duckworth (6).
Referring to King vs Simmonds (7), Pearce vs Chaplin (8) and Tinkler vs Hilder (9) which I have earlier (1) , 483.(2) (3) (5) 32 1.
(7) ; (1846) 9 Q.B. 802.
(9) (1849) 4 Exc 1187: ; 368 cited, Rankin, C.J., said (p. 714) that they ""are clearly inapplicable except upon the basis that the Defendant is seeking to challenge an order after accepting the benefit of a term or condition imposed upon the Opposite, Party at whose instance the order was made"".
He was of the view that this basis did not exist in the case which he had before him.
Rankin, C.J., also referred to another old English case, namely, Kennard vs Harris (1).
, There, a rule to set aside an award of an arbitrator was discharged when it was shown that the party who had obtained the rule had accepted the costs of the reference and the award.
Rankin, C.J., said with reference to this case that (p. 713), ""A person who accepts costs payable under an award or any other sum of money given to him by an award is held to be precluded from asking the Court to set aside the award"".
He however also observed that An award is bad unless it deals with the whole matter submitted and prima facie cannot be set aside in part only"".
It may be that Rankin, C.J., was making a distinction, which is obviously correct, between an award which can be set aside only as a whole because it is one and indivisible and a judgment which might be in severable parts in which case, the adoption of a part by a party would not preclude him from challenging another part which was independent.
Rankin, C.J., did not think, and if I may say so with respect, correctly, that the principle of Kennard vs Harris (1) had any application to the facts of the case before him, for, there no part of the judgment was sought to be challenged by the appeal, excepting perhaps an independent part which by implication rejected the appellant 's claim to a larger sum.
In Venkatarayudu 's case (2), Venkatasubba Rao, J., after discussing various cases, to some of which I have referred, observed, (p. 141) ""What is the principle underlying these decisions? When an order shows plainly that it is intended to take effect in its entirety and that several parts of it depend upon each other, (1) ; (1824) 2 B. & C. 80; (2) 369 a person cannot adopt one part and repudiate another"".
It seems to me beyond doubt that the principle of these cases is applicable to the facts of the present appeal.
Here we have a decree which is one and indivisible.
The effect of it is that upon the respondent paying the money into court he would be entitled to the property and to obtain possession of it and the appellant would be entitled to withdraw the money.
The appellant has no right to the money whatsoever independent of the decree; he had no right to compel the respondent to purchase the property from him on payment of a price.
Indeed the appellant had been contending that the respondent was not entitled to purchase the property from him by paying the price.
The appellant could have drawn out the money only on the basis that the decree had been properly passed.
Therefore, by withdrawing the money he adopted its correctness and cannot now say it is incorrect.
It seems to me that the observation of Venkatasubba Rao, J., in Venkatarayudu 's case (1) (P. 141) that "" to allow a party, who takes a benefit under such an order, to complain against it, would be to permit a breach of faith"", would apply fully to the conduct of the appellant.
So would the observations of Rankin, C. J., in Hurrybux Deora 's case (2) on King vs Simmonds (3), Pearce vs Chaplin (4) and Tinkler vs Hilder (5).
The present is a case where the appellant was seeking to challenge an order after accepting the benefit of a term or condition, that is to say, as to the payment of money into court, imposed upon the respondent at whose instance the order was made; that the obligation to pay money was a term or condition 'imposed upon the respondent is manifest because the decree provided that if the money was not paid, the suit would stand dismissed with costs.
Again the judgment in the present case is like an award for it is one whole and cannot be set aside in parts.
Therefore what (1) (3) ; (2) (4) (1846) 9 Q.B. 802.
(5) ; 47 370 Rankin, C. J., said in regard to Kennard vs Harris which turned on an award, namely, that a person who accepts costs or a sum of money given to him by an award cannot ask to have it set aside, would also be applicable.
I find it impossible to conceive that this judgment consists of several parts or that such parts are severable.
The learned counsel for the appellant was able to refer us to only one case in support of his contention that the appeal could be proceeded with and that was Sunder Das vs Dhanpat Rai (2).
That was also a case of pre emption.
There, however, the plaintiff who had obtained the decree for pre emption in his favour, had executed that decree and obtained possession of the property concerned.
The defendant appealed from the decree but was unsuccessful.
in the first appellate court.
He then appealed to the Chief Court at Lahore and when the appeal was pending there, withdrew the purchase money paid into court by the plaintiff under the decree of the trial Court.
The Chief Court held that this (lid not preclude the defendant from proceeding with the appeal before it.
The facts of that case were substantially different from those before us.
It may be said that the defendant having been compelled to part with the property, was justified in withdrawing of the money from the court and that a withdrawal in such circumstances did not amount to an adoption of the decree.
That cannot be said in the present case.
Whether on the facts, Sunder Das 's case (2) was rightly decided or not, is not a matter on which I feel called upon to express any opinion.
If however that case intended to lay down a principle which would warrant the appellant on the facts of the case in band in proceeding_ with this appeal, I am unable to agree with it.
It would then be in conflict with all the authorities on the point and none of these was noticed in the judgment, in that case.
I do not think that Sunder Das 's case (2) is of sufficient authority to warrant a departure from the principle uniformly followed by the courts.
(1) ; (2) 1907 P.R.
No 16.
371 It is necessary, however, before I conclude, to refer to the comparatively recent case of Lissenden vs C. A. V. Bosch Ltd. (1).
That was a case in which a workman who had been awarded compensation for partial incapacity up to a certain date accepted the compensation so awarded and thereafter preferred an appeal claiming that compensation should have been awarded to him beyond that date and so long as he should be incapacitated.
The Court of Appeal feeling itself bound by its earlier decision in Johnson vs Newton Fire Extinguisher Company (2) had held, somewhat reluctantly, that the workman having accepted money under the award could not challenge its validity by an appeal.
In Johnson 's case (2), it appears to have been held that a workman could not.
accept part of an award and claim to amend another part for that would be an attempt to ""approbate and reprobate"" the award and this could not be allowed.
The House of Lords in Lissenden 's case (1) held that Johnson 's case (2) had been wrongly decided and that the workman before it was entitled to proceed with the appeal.
The reason for, this view was that acceptance by the workman of what had been found to be due to him does not operate to prevent him from appealing for some further relief.
The case therefore was the same as that before Rankin, C. J., in Hurrybux Deora vs Johurmull Bhotoria (3).
The substance of the decision of the House of Lords was that there was no inconsistency between the appeal and the adoption of the award.
That however cannot be said in the case before us now.
The House of Lords also pointed out that the Court of Appeal had misunderstood the doctrine against "" approbating and reprobating"".
It was said that that was a doctrine of Scottish law which in England had been held by High authorities to be equivalent to the equitable principle of election.
It was observed that that equitable principle depended for its application on the intention of the executant of an instrument and was, therefore, not applicable to a case like the (1) [1940) A.C. 412.
(2) (3) 372 one the House of Lords had before it.
It was also pointed out that the common law principle of election had no application either for, it depended on the h existence of two rights or remedies, one alone of which could be chosen and in the case of an appeal there were no two rights or remedies.
I do not think the observations of the House of Lords on the doctrine against ""approbating and reprobating"" affect the question before us.
All the learned Judges who delivered opinions in the case, including Lord Atkin, who expressed himself with some reservation, accepted tile position that a litigant may lose his right of appeal by reason of his conduct after the judgment or award for, by such conduct he may be estopped from appealing or may be considered in equity or at law as having released his right of appeal: see p. 420,429, 430 and 434.
Lissenden 's case (1) does not, therefore, in my view throw any doubt on the principle that a litigant may be precluded from proceeding with an appeal if that would be inconsistent with his previous conduct in regard to the decree challenged by the appeal.
It seems to me that the courts in England have taken the same view of Lissenden 's case (1).
In Baxter vs Eckersley (2) the Court of Appeal expressly approved of the principle laid down in Dexter 's case(3).
In Banque Des Marchands De Moscou vs Kindersley (4) Evershed, M. R., referring to the phrases ""approbating and reprobating"" and ""blowing hot and blowing cold"" said at p. 119, ""These phrases must be taken to express, first, that the party in question is to be treated as having made an election from which he cannot resile, and, second, that he will not be regarded, at least in a case such as the present, as having so elected unless lie has taken a benefit under or arising out of the course of conduct which he has first pursued and with which his pre sent action is inconsistent"".
These two cases, it will be observed, were decided after Lissenden 's case (1).
All these authorities leave no doubt in my mind that the rule preventing inconsistent conduct is firmly (1) (3) (2) (4) 373 established.
I think, for the reasons earlier mentioned, that the rule is properly applicable in the present case and the appellant cannot be allowed to proceed with the appeal.
I wish however to make it clear that the applicability of the rule will depend on the facts of each case; it will depend on whether there has been actual inconsistency.
I have found that there has been adoption in the present case and the prosecution of the appeal will result in the conduct of the appellant becoming inconsistent.
That is, all that I decide.
Before leaving the case, I think I ought to observe that the fact that the appellant had withdrawn the money after he had obtained leave from this Court makes no difference to the applicability of the principle.
It was by such withdrawal that he adopted the decree and thereafter he is precluded from proceeding with the appeal.
There is as much inconsistency in the present case as there would have been, if the appellant had withdrawn the money before he had obtained the leave.
For these reasons I would dismiss the appeal with costs.
By COURT: In accordance with the majority judgment, the preliminary objection is overruled.
The appeal will now be set down for hearing on merits.
Preliminary objection overruled.
Appeal set down for hearing.
","In a suit instituted by the respondent for the enforcement of the right of pre emption against the appellant, the trial court dismissed the suit but on appeal a decree was passed on March 24, 1952 under which upon the respondent paying the amount found payable as purchase money into court within four months, his title to the property would be deemed to have accrued from the date of the payment into court.
The appellant applied for special leave to appeal to the Supreme Court and leave was granted on May 20, 1953, confining the appeal to the constitutional point raised therein, that the Rewa State Pre emption Act, 1949, was unconstitutional on the ground that it placed an unreasonable restriction upon the right to acquire property enumerated in article 19(1)(f) of the Constitution of India.
In the meantime, the respondent deposited the price of pre emption into court within the time fixed in the decree and on November 14, 1953, the appellant withdrew the money from court.
The appeal to the Supreme Court came on for hearing in due course and the question arose on a preliminary objection raised by the respondent whetber the appellant was precluded from proceeding with the appeal on the ground that by withdrawing the pre emption price he must be deemed to have accepted the decree and that he could not, therefore, be heard to say that the decree was erroneous.
The respondent relied upon the doctrine that a person cannot be allowed to approbate and reprobate.
Held (Sarkar, J., dissenting), that the act of the appellant in withdrawing the pre emption price did not amount to an adoption by him of the decree which he had specifically challenged in his appeal and, in the absence of some statutory provision or of a well recognised principle of equity, he could not be deprived of his statutory right of appeal.
Accordingly, the appellant was not precluded from proceeding ;with the appeal.
The principle that a person who takes benefit under an order cannot repudiate that part of the order which is detrimental to him, on the ground that he cannot be allowed to approbate and reprobate, is applicable only to cases where the 359 benefit conferred by the order is something apart from the merits of the claim involved.
A vendee in a pre emption suit against whom a decree is passed has a right to be paid the pre emption price before the decree becomes effective, but the price cannot be characterised as a benefit under the decree; it is only in the nature of compensation to the vendee for the loss of his property.
Tinkler vs Hilder, ; , VerschuYes Creameries vs Hull and Netherlands Steamship CO., , Lissenden vs C. A. V. Bosch Ltd., , Venkatarayudu vs Chinna, and Sundra Das vs Dhanpat Rai, 1907 P.R. No. 16, considered.
Per Sarkar, J. The decree was one and indivisible and the appellant had no right to the money whatsoever independent of the decree and he could have drawn out the money only on the basis that the decree had been properly passed.
By withdrawing the money he adopted its correctness and cannot now say it is incorrect.
The prosecution of the appeal will result in the conduct of the appellant becoming inconsistent and he cannot, therefore, be allowed to proceed with the appeal.
Case law reviewed.
</s>","  The question for determination in this appeal is whether the Rewa State Pre emption Act, 1949, is unconstitutional on the ground that it places an unreasonable restriction upon the right to acquire property enumerated in cl.
(1)(f) of article 19 of the Constitution.
This question arises in the following circumstances.
On January 20, 1949, the plaintiff respondent No. 1 filed a suit in the court of the District Judge, Rewa, for a declaration that the defendant appellant was not entitled to purchase the land in dispute under the provisions of the Rewa State Pre emption Act, 1949, and for injunction restraining the defendant from purchasing the land.
The defendant appellant filed a written statement denying the allegations made in the plaint and prayed for dismissal of the suit.
The trial court decreed the suit in favour of the plaintiff respondent No. 1 and directed the defendant appellant to deposit the price of pre emption within six months from the date of the decree.
The defendant appellant deposited the price of pre emption but later withdrew it.
Thereafter, the plaintiff respondent No. 1 filed an appeal to the Judicial Commissioner's Court, Rewa, against the decree passed by the trial court.
The defendant appellant also filed an appeal to the same court against the decree passed by the trial court.
The appeals were heard together and the Judicial Commissioner's Court, Rewa, dismissed both the appeals and confirmed the decree passed by the trial court.
Against the decree of the Judicial Commissioner's Court, Rewa, the defendant appellant filed a second appeal to the High Court of Judicature at Allahabad.
The High Court dismissed the second appeal and confirmed the decree passed by the Judicial Commissioner's Court, Rewa.
The defendant appellant then applied for special leave to appeal to this Court against the decree passed by the High Court.
Special leave was granted and the present appeal is heard by us on the question whether the Rewa State Pre emption Act, 1949, is unconstitutional on the ground that it places an unreasonable restriction upon the right to acquire property enumerated in cl.
(1)(f) of article 19 of the Constitution.
It is not disputed that the Rewa State Pre emption Act, 1949, is a law made by the Rewa State Legislature and that it is binding on the courts of that State.
The only question is whether it is a valid law within the meaning of article 13 of the Constitution.
Article 13 provides that Parliament shall enact laws for the enforcement of the fundamental rights conferred by Part III of the Constitution.
The question is whether the Rewa State Pre emption Act, 1949, is a law within the meaning of article 13.
The argument of the learned counsel for the appellant is that the Rewa State Pre emption Act, 1949, is a law within the meaning of article 13 because it is a law made by the Rewa State Legislature for the enforcement of the fundamental rights conferred by Part III of the Constitution.
The argument of the learned counsel for the respondent is that the Rewa State Pre emption Act, 1949, is not a law within the meaning of article 13 because it does not make any provision for the enforcement of the fundamental rights conferred by Part III of the Constitution.
We are unable to accept the argument of the learned counsel for the appellant.
The Rewa State Pre emption Act, 1949, makes provision for the enforcement of the fundamental rights conferred by Part III of the Constitution.
Section 10 of the Act provides that the provisions of the Act shall be in addition to and not in derogation of the provisions of the Constitution.
Section 11 provides that the provisions of the Act shall apply to all lands situate within the territories of the Rewa State.
Section 12 provides that the provisions of the Act shall be in force from the date of its publication in the official gazette.
Section 13 provides that every person who contravenes any provision of the Act shall be punishable with imprisonment for a term which may extend to three years or with fine which may extend to five hundred rupees or with both.
Section 14 provides that no suit or prosecution shall lie against the State Government or any officer or servant of the State Government for anything done or purported to be done in good faith under the Act.
Section 15 provides that no suit or prosecution shall lie against any person for anything done or purported to be done in good faith under the Act.
Section 16 provides that no suit or prosecution shall lie against the State Government or any officer or servant of the State Government for anything done or purported to be done in good faith under any other law for the time being in force relating to the acquisition of land.
Section 17 provides that no suit or prosecution shall lie against any person for anything done or purported to be done in good faith under any other law for the time being in force relating to the acquisition of land.
Section 18 provides that no suit or prosecution shall lie against the State Government or any officer or servant of the State Government for anything done or purported to be done in good faith under the Rewa State Pre emption Act, 1949, or any other law for the time being in force relating to the acquisition of land.

M/S.Raju Construction vs The Government Of India, 2022 SCC OnLine Mad 16024

","The articles of the Indian Constitution applicable to the case M/S.Raju Construction vs The Government Of India are Article 14 and Article 19.

Article 14 of the Indian Constitution guarantees the right to equality. It states that the State shall not deny to any person equality before the law or equal protection of the laws within the territory of India. In this case, the petitioners challenged the withdrawal of exemption from service tax, claiming that it violated their right to equality under Article 14.

Article 19 of the Indian Constitution guarantees the right to freedom. It provides certain freedoms to all citizens, including the freedom to practice any profession, occupation, trade, or business. The petitioners may have argued that the withdrawal of exemption interfered with their freedom to carry out their construction services without the burden of service tax.

These articles were relevant in determining the validity of the withdrawal of exemption and whether it violated the petitioners' constitutional rights.</s>","The articles of the Indian Constitution applicable to the case M/S.Raju Construction vs The Government Of India are Article 32 and Article 12. Article 32 grants the right to move the Supreme Court for the enforcement of fundamental rights. In this case, the petitioners moved the Supreme Court under Article 32 seeking relief against the government's decision to withdraw the exemption from service tax on construction services. Article 12 guarantees equal protection before the law and prohibits discrimination on grounds of religion, race, caste, sex, or place of birth. In this case, the petitioners alleged that the withdrawal of the exemption was arbitrary and violated their right to equality under Article 14. However, the court held that there was no violation of Article 14 as the exemption was granted by the Central Government in exercise of its executive power and not based on any discriminatory criteria. Therefore, the court did not consider the applicability of Article 12 in this case.   It is important to note that the court's interpretation of the constitutional provisions may vary depending on the specific facts and circumstances of each case. The court's decision should be examined in light of the relevant legal principles and precedents. Additionally, it is always advisable to consult with legal experts for a detailed analysis of the constitutional implications of a particular case.   It is worth mentioning that the court also considered other constitutional provisions such as Article 15(4) and Article 298, but the court did not rely on these provisions in its reasoning. Therefore, the focus of the court's decision was primarily on Articles 32 and 12.   Overall, the court's decision in this case highlights the importance of interpreting constitutional provisions in the context of the specific facts and circumstances of each case. It emphasizes the need for careful consideration and application of constitutional principles to ensure justice and protect the rights of individuals.   It is important to note that the court's decision may be subject to appeal and review by higher courts. Any subsequent decisions or interpretations may differ from the present case. Therefore, it is essential to stay updated on legal developments and seek professional advice when necessary.   It is also worth mentioning that the court's decision in this case does not necessarily bind future courts or establish a binding precedent. Each case is decided on its own merits, taking into account the specific facts and legal arguments presented. However, the court's interpretation of constitutional provisions can provide guidance and influence future judgments.   In conclusion, the articles of the Indian Constitution applicable to the case M/S.Raju Construction vs The Government Of India are Articles 32 and 12. These articles were considered by the court in determining the validity of the government's decision to withdraw the exemption from service tax on construction services. While the court held that there was no violation of Article 14, it did not consider the applicability of Article 12 in this case. It is important to consult with legal experts for a detailed analysis of the constitutional implications of a particular case.   It is crucial to stay informed about legal developments and seek professional advice when necessary. The court's decision in this case highlights the importance of interpreting constitutional provisions in the context of the specific facts and circumstances of each case. It emphasizes the need for careful consideration and application of constitutional principles to ensure justice and protect the rights of individuals.   Overall, the court's decision in this case serves as a reminder of the significance of constitutional provisions in shaping the legal landscape and ensuring the protection of fundamental rights. It underscores the importance of understanding and applying constitutional principles in the context of individual cases.

"<s>[INST] Summarize:relations between the testatrix and the appellant were very cordial those between her and the respondent were far from being cordial.
There could be no occasion for her to suddenly change her mind to revoke the will so as to benefit the respondent whom she despised.
Secondly, being an extremely religious and charitable lady, it is difficult to believe that she would shed her inclinations by revoking the will deleting the religious purposes and giving benefit to the respondent to make him the absolute owner of the properties.
Thirdly in all the earlier dispositions a clause was inserted prohibiting the trustees from alienating the properties.
Had she revoked the will the result would have been that the property would go to the respondent without any conditions, a conduct that would be against her temperament.
Fourthly the respondent and his wife had access to the house of the testatrix and therefore the possibility that he or his wife might have pilfered the will could not be excluded.
Lastly there was no evidence that the testatrix had at any time expressed a desire to revoke the will nor was there evidence to show that the respondent was gaining her favour at any time before her death.
[888D H, 889D, G, H] & CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION: Civil Appeal No. 55 of 1969.
From the Judgment and Order dated 15 2 67 of the Delhi High Court in L.A.P. No. 146 D of 1963.
K. T. Hrindra Nath, Gautam Goswami and B. B. Sinha for the Appellant.
Sardar Bahadur Saharya and Vishnu Bahadur Saharya for Respondent No. 1.
The Judgment of the Court was delivered by FAZAL ALI, J.
This appeal by certificate is directed against the judgment of the Delhi High Court dated 15 2 1967 reversing the decision of the single Judge and dismissing the application filed for grant of probate by the appellant of a will said to have been executed by Smt.
Jog Maya on the 1st July, 1947 and registered on 9th July, 1947.
Jog Maya died on 22 10 1955.
Soon thereafter the appellant who was the sole legatee and executor under the will filed a petition before the District Judge, Delhi for grant of letters of administration or probate.
Put briefly the appellant 's case was that Smt.
Jog Maya was a resident of Mohalla Rang Mahal, Nahar Sadat Khan, Delhi and although she had an adopted son, namely, the respondent Pt.
Devi Charan there was no love lost between Smt.
Jog Maya and Devi Charan so much so that in her will the testatrix expressly mentioned that the adopted son should not be permitted to perform her 876 funeral rites on her death nor should he be allowed to touch her body.
The appellant Durga Prasad on the other hand was looking after the affairs of the lady and doing her work from time to time.
It was perhaps in lieu of the services rendered by the appellant that Smt.
Jog Maya executed a will in his favour on 1st July, 1947.
The proceedings for probate were contested by Devi Charan who denied the execution of the will on the ground that Smt.
Jogmaya was not of sound disposing mind when she is said to have executed the will but had been persuaded to do so by undue influence exercised by the appellant in executing the will.
It was also alleged by the respondent Devi Charan that the will was subsequently revoked and that is why it was not found in the house despite every possible search.
The District Judge accepted the plea of the respondent and dismissed the application for probate by his order dated 3 5 1957.
The appellant, therefore, filed an appeal to the High Court which was heard by Mr. Justice P. D. Sharma who reversed the decision of the District Judge and found that the will was a genuine document and had not been revoked.
He accordingly allowed the petition of Durga Prasad and issued letters of probate or administration.
The respondent went up in appeal to the Division Bench which reversed the finding of the Single Judge and restored the order of the District Judge dismissing the application for probate.
It would appear from a perusal of the Judgment of the Division Bench of the High Court that so far as the factual aspect regarding the execution of he will was concerned it agreed with the findings of fact given by the Single Judge that the will was a genuine document and was duly executed by the testatrix who had a sound disposing mind and no fraud or undue influence at all had been practised in the execution of the will which was witnessed by as many as 7 attesting witnesses some of whom had been examined before the District Judge to prove the execution of the will.
In this connection, the High Court observed as follows: ""As regards the issue Nos. 1 and 2, as already stated above, the learned Single Judge held that the evidence on record was sufficient to prove that Smt.
Jog Maya executed the will (copy) exhibit
P. 10, and that she was of sound and disposing mind at the time of the execution, as held by the learned District Judge.
But the Courts have thus given concurrent findings on issues Nos. 1 and 2, viz., on the questions as to whether Jog Maya executed the alleged will dated 1st July, 1947, (certified copy of which has been put on 877 the record and marked as exhibit P.10) and whether Jog Maya was of sound and disposing state of mind when she executed the said will"".
In view of this categorical finding of the High Court it is manifest that the point in dispute lies within a very narrow compass.
The High Court while accepting the genuineness of the will has non suited the appellant only on the ground that as the will was not found on the death of the testatrix despite every attempt to search for it, a presumption would have to be drawn that the testatrix had revoked the will by destroying it before her death.
In view of this presumption the High Court held that the will appears to have been revoked and consequently refused to grant probate to the appellant.
Mr. Hrindranath, counsel for the appellant submitted in the first place that the High Court was in error in applying the presumption of the revocation of the will in view of the express provisions of section 70 of the hereinafter called the Act.
It was contended in the alternative that even if the presumption was available to the respondent, the same being a rebuttable one was sufficiently rebutted by facts and circumstances proved in the case.
The High Court has relied on a number of decisions in support of its view that from the fact that the will was not found on the death of the deceased Smt.
Jog Maya, a presumption would have to be drawn that the will was revoked by her before her death.
Mr. Saharya, counsel for the respondent on the other hand supported the reasons given by the High Court and submitted that in the circumstances there was no alternative but to draw the presumption that the will was revoked.
Before however deciding the question of law arising in the present appeal, it may be necessary to set out a few facts against the background of which the point of law could be easily decided.
It appears that Smt.
Jog Maya was a very clever woman and personally looked after her own affairs as found by the High Court.
The High Court also found that Smt.
Jog Maya was a woman of a very religious and charitable bent of mind and had executed as many as three wills including the will in question and in all of them she had made adequate provision for Puja in the house and other charitable purposes.
Jog Maya had purchased the house situated in Rang Mahal, Nahar Sadat Khan, No. 667, in or about 1933.
She resided in the front portion of the ground floor and leased out the back portion of the ground floor to tenants.
She got a temple constructed in the upper storey and installed the idols of Lakshmi Narain and Hanuman, on 11 3 1935.
On 7th May, 1935 she executed a will and got regis 878 tered on 9th May, 1935.
In this will she clearly stated that she was performing Puja and service of the temple from out of the income of the rents of the building.
She further declared in the will that the house was made Wakf and dedicated to the temple and would remain so for all times to come.
Under the will five respectable persons were made the trustees, but Smt.
Jog Maya reserved the right of managing the property to herself and it was only after her death that the trustees were to manage the property and perform Puja etc.
Three years later on 12th July, 1938 Smt.
Jog Maya executed another will and got it registered on 18th July, 1938.
By this will she revoked the previous will of 1935 and dedicated a part of the house, some deposits in some banks, ornaments and other household goods for the benefit of the temple.
She retained the provision that she would manage the property and realise the rents till her life time after which the property was to be managed by seven persons nominated by her under the will.
In this will Smt.
Jog Maya expressly prohibited the respondent Devi Charan who was her adopted son from performing her funeral rites, but she gave Devi Charan and his wife the right to appropriate the rent of the two houses after the payment of taxes and repairs and after the death of the trustees.
There was also a clause which prohibited the trustees from alienating the endowed properties.
This will also shows the religious and charitable disposition of Smt.
Jog Maya.
The third will which is the will in question was executed on 1st July, 1947 and registered on 9th July, 1947.
By this will Smt.
Jog Maya cancelled the will of 1938 and declared the same as void and bequeathed all her properties, movable and immovable, to the appellant Pt.
Durga Prashad who was also appointed the executor of the will.
The will however contains a clear clause that Durga Prashad will be the owner of all the properties he would have no right of alienating the house but would only be entitled to realise the rent and income from the properties which he should spend in the performance of Puja in the temple and appropriate the balance himself.
In this will also there was a prohibition clause under which it was said that Devi Charan would have no concern with her estate, movable and immovable, and he should not even touch her dead body.
So far as the upper portion of the house is concerned, which was converted into a private temple where a deity was installed that is not the subject matter of the will and there is no dispute about the same.
The dispute between the parties centres round the ground portion of the house and other movable properties.
After the death of Smt.
Jog Maya the house was locked up by the neighbours and later a search was conducted as a result of which though 879 the original will was not found a draft will almost of the same time as the will in question was found which is Ext.
No date is given in this draft but Jog Maya has described herself as being 63 years of age which would show that this draft was written almost at the same time as the will.
According to this draft, apart from Durga Prashad one Pandit Ram Nath was also appointed as executor and trustee of the properties of Jog Maya.
The usual directions for carrying on the Puja and other charitable purposes was also found in this draft.
In the draft also it was clarified that Devi Charan had no connection with the house or with the properties which were the subject matter of the will and had executed a release deed in favour of Jog Maya.
As regards Devi Charan the following recitals appear in the draft: ""I and Devi Charan have not been given rights of alienation and it is also mentioned in the will about Devi Charan that if he remains of good conduct he will be entitled to receive Rs. 10/ p.m.
As his character became bad on attaining majority, my father in law secured a release deed from him registered at No. 2200, Book I Volume 558 dated 26 8 1929 in my favour.
From that time my son Devi has no connection with those houses and with my movable and immovable property. . Eightly.
I specially direct that Devi Charan should not perform my funeral ceremonies and the trustees should get them performed by another"".
It would thus appear that the relations between the respondent and the testatrix were extremely strained at the time when the will in question was executed and it appears that the testatrix did not wish that the respondent should have anything to do with her properties and any concession she had made in his favour in her two previous wills appears to have been completely withdrawn by the impugned will.
Even Prem Shankar one of the witnesses examined by the respondent clearly admitted that Devi Charan was not made a trustee by that trust deed because Smt.
Jog Maya was offended with him.
The appellant has also stated in his evidence that relations between the respondent and the testatrix were not good.
A careful analysis therefore of the previous wills or draft executed by Jog Maya show the presence of the following important features in all these documents: 1.
That relations between the respondent and Smt.
Jog Maya were extremely strained so much so that he was not permitted to perform her funeral rites or touch her body.
880 2.
Substantial provision was made for religious and charitable purposes in all the wills.
Express prohibition was made in all the wills regarding alienating the properties by the legatees or the trustees.
That in the draft will as also the impugned will Durga Prashad was constituted as the executor of the will.
We will develop these features a little later after discussing the points of law involved in the case.
The High Court appears to have drawn the presumption regarding the revocation of the will from two facts.
In the first place, it was found that there was no positive evidence to show that the will was in existence at the time of the death of the testatrix.
In this connection, it relied on the evidence of Durga Prashad that a few days prior to her death Jog Maya had told him that the original will was in safe custody in the bank, but this fact was falsified by the circumstance that when the sealed box kept in the bank was opened no will was found.
In our opinion, in the initial application which the appellant gave for grant of probate, he did not mention at all that Jog Maya told him that the original will was kept in safe custody in the bank.
This averment was made in an amended application which was given by him before the District Judge.
In the circumstances, therefore, we feel that no such statement was ever made by Jog Maya to the appellant who tried to overstate his case which was clearly an after thought otherwise there was no reason why he should not have mentioned this fact in the initial petition for the grant of probate which he filed before the District Judge.
In these circumstances, not much turns upon what Durga Prashad says about the will being in the box.
The High Court then relied on the circumstance that in spite of every possible search while the draft exhibit C 1 was in fact found the will was not found at all.
The High Court, therefore, drew presumption that the testatrix must have revoked the will by destruction or otherwise.
The question as to whether or not a presumption should be drawn in such cases as a rule of law is extremely doubtful.
Moreover, even if any such presumption is drawn the said presumption is rebuttable and may be rebutted either by direct or circumstantial evidence.
In the first place, the High Court relied on the case of Anna Maria Welch and Lucy Allen Welch vs Nathaniel Phillips where the Privy Council observed as follows: ""Now the rule of the law of evidence on this subject, as established by a course of decisions in the Ecclesiastical Court, is this: ""that if a will, traced to the possession of the 881 deceased, and last seen there, is not forthcoming on his death, it is presumed to have been destroyed by himself; and that presumption must have effect, unless there is sufficient evidence to repel it.
It is a presumption founded on good sense"".
The serious question for us to determine is whether the ratio of this case can be applied to Indian conditions with full force.
This matter was clearly considered by the Privy Council in the case from India in Padman & Ors.
vs Hanwanta & Ors.
where the Privy Council sounded a note of caution in applying the aforesaid presumption to this country having regarding to the nature and habits of the people of our country.
While approving the observations of the Chief Court their Lordships in the aforesaid case observed as follows: ""We think that the more reasonable presumption in this case is that the will was mislaid and lost, or else was stolen by one of the defendants after the death of Daula.
Their Lordships think that it was perfectly within the competency of the learned Judges to come to that finding.
Much stress has been laid on the view expressed by Baron Parke, in Welch vs Phillips ; that when a will is traced to the possession of the deceased and is not forthcoming at his death, the presumption is that he has destroyed it.
In view of the habits and conditions of the people of India this rule of law, if it can be so called, must be applied with considerable caution.
In the present case the deceased was a very old man and, towards the end of his life, almost imbecile.
There is nothing definite to show that he had any motive to destroy the will or was mentally competent to do so.
On the other hand, the circumstances favour the view the Chief Court has taken that the will was either mislaid or stolen"".
The Privy Council made it very clear that the more reasonable presumption in a case like this should be that the will was mislaid, lost or stolen rather than that it was revoked.
The Privy Council further endorsed the fact that the presumption of English law should be applied to Indian conditions with considerable caution.
The High Court in the instant case does not appear to have kept in view the note of warning sounded by the Privy Council in the aforesaid case.
882 There are a large number of authorities of the Indian High Courts which take the view that even if the presumption is applied it should be applied with very great cautions.
Before however dealing with these authorities we would like to san the English law on the point.
Jarman on Wills while dwelling on this aspect of the matter observed as follows: ""If a will is traced into the testator 's possession, and is not found at his death, the presumption is that he destroyed it for the purpose of revoking it; but the presumption may be rebutted. .
Where the will makes a careful and detailed disposition of the testator 's property, and nothing happens to make it probable that he wishes to revoke it, the presumption raised by the disappearance of the will may be rebutted by slight evidence, especially if it is shown that access to the box, or other place of deposit where the will was kept, could be obtained by persons whose interest it is to defeat the will"".
It is, therefore, clear that even if a presumption of the revocation of the will is drawn from the fact that it was not found on the death of the testatrix it cannot be laid down as a general rule and can be rebutted even by slight evidence particularly where it is shown that some party had access to the place of deposit.
The Privy Council has doubted whether this presumption is a rule of law at all.
In Halsbury 's Laws of England, Third Edition, Vol. 39 at p. 896 it was thus observed: ""Where a will is found destroyed or mutilated, in a place in which the testator would naturally put it if he thought he had destroyed it, the presumption is that testator destroyed it, and that the destruction was done animo revocandi. . . .
Similarly, if a will was last traced to the possession of the testator and is not forthcoming at his decease, there is a prima facie presumption, in the absence of circumstances tending to a contrary conclusion that the testator destroyed it animo revocandi.
The presumption may be rebutted by evidence, which, however, must be clear and satisfactory.
Recent declarations by a testator of satisfaction at having settled his affairs, or of goodwill towards the persons benefited by the will, or of adherence to the will and to the contents of the will itself may be used for this purpose.
The presumption may, it seems, also be rebutted by a consideration of the contents of the will itself"".
883 It appears that so far as the United States is concerned no presumption as a rule of law can be drawn where the will is lost but the matter depends on the statute of a particular State.
In Corpus Juris Secundum Vol.
95 it has been observed as follows: ""Since, in accordance with the general rule that a will speaks from the death of the testator, an instrument which has been duly executed as a will, and never been revoked, becomes effective on the death of the testator although it cannot be found or is not in existence, it is a well settled general rule, which in some jurisdictions is in effect prescribed by statute, that a will which has been lost or destroyed, either after the testator 's death or accidentally or fraudulently during his lifetime, may be established or admitted the probate, as by admitting a properly proved copy or duplicate of the will to probate or by a proceeding in accordance with the statute, in the court having jurisdiction thereof, and on competent and sufficient proof of its execution, loss, or destruction, and contents"".
Thus, it is manifest that in the first place when the will is traced to the possession of the testator but not found at the time of death, no presumption can be drawn as a rule of law but in the facts and circumstances of a particular case such a presumption may be drawn and can be rebutted even by slight evidence.
In the case of Finch vs Finch(1) the Court observed as follows: ""There is no doubt that if a man dies, after duly executing a will, and at the time of his death his will, having remained in his custody, is not in existence, the law presumes that it was revoked.
But in all such cases the question to be determined is, whether the will was or was not in existence at the time of the death"" ""The evidence certainly points strongly in that direction, and there is nothing to shew any change of intention which was likely to lead to the revocation of the will.
He had evidently not changed his mind when he last spoke to his daughter on the subject, and, as to the three weeks that elapsed between that conversation and his death, the evidence is a perfect blank.
There is nothing to shew any change of intention, but there is evidence that, during that interval, he was not on good terms with his son, and that, although they were living in the same house, they did not speak to each other"".
884 Although the Court stated the law clearly that a presumption in such circumstances could be drawn it held that the presumption was rebutted by the important fact that there was nothing to show that there was any other in the intention of the testator to revoke the will.
On the other hand, strained relations between the father who was the testator and the son continued.
In these circumstances, it was held that the presumption was rebutted.
Against this background we shall now deal with the authorities of the Indian High Courts.
But before we do that it may be necessary to extract section 70 of the Act: ""No unprivileged will or codicil, nor any part thereof shall be revoked otherwise than by marriage, or by another will or codicil, or by some writing declaring an intention to revoke the same and executed in the manner in which an unprivileged will is hereinbefore required to be executed, or by the burning, tearing or otherwise destroying the same by the testator or by some person in his presence and by his direction with the intention of revoking the same"".
A perusal of this section would clearly reveal two important features.
In the first place, the section has been couched in negative terms having a mandatory content.
Secondly, the section provides the mode and the circumstances under which an intention to revoke can be established.
In these circumstances, therefore, the onus is on the objector who relies on the revocation to prove that the will had been revoked after it has been proved to have been duly executed.
Under section 70 of the Act the will can be revoked inter alia, by burning, tearing or otherwise destroying and unless any of the circumstances has been proved by the objector by cogent evidence, the question of the revocation of the will naturally not arise.
While construing this section, this Court in the case of Anil Behari Ghosh vs Smt.
Latika Bala Dassi & Ors.
observed as follows: ""For proving that the will had been revoked, it had to be shown that the testator had made another will or codicil or by some writing declared his intention to revoke the will.
Such a document is required by section 70 of the Act to be executed in the same manner as a will.
Such a revocation could also have been proved, as the section lays down, by turning, tearing or otherwise destroying the will by the testator himself or by some other person in his presence and by his direction, thus clearly indicating his intention of revoking the will"".
885 Applying these observations to the facts of the present case there is absolutely no evidence to show that even though Smt.
Jog Maya had made a registered will in favour of the appellant she revoked it at any time in the manner enjoined by section 70 of the Act.
In the case of Kaikhushru Jehangir vs Bai Bachubai Jehangir & Ors.
while construing section 70 of the Act it was pointed out that a will cannot be revoked by implication.
In this connection, the Court made the following observations: ""Under the statute it is necessary to establish an intention to destroy.
There cannot be any revocation by necessary implication.
The revocation can only be by one or the other of the modes which are specified in the statute, and so far as we are here concerned, these modes are specified in section 70, Succession Act"".
In the case of Babu Lal Singh & Anr.
vs Baijnath Singh & Anr.
a Division Bench of the Patna High Court while referring to the Privy Council case of Welch vs Phillips (supra) observed as follows: ""In my opinion the essential condition of the rule of English law 'if a will traced to the possession of the deceased and last seen there is not forthcoming on his death ' has not been established.
Therefore the presumption of law on which Mr. Das laid much stress has no application to the facts of the present case . .The onus primarily lies on the party propounding the copy to account for the absence of the original . .
Thus there is nothing to show any change of intention, which was likely to lead to the revocation of the will.
In the circumstances the only reasonable inference is that the document is either mislaid or lost.
The loss of a will does not operate as a revocation.
It has been established that the will was duly executed by Man body and there is no uncertainty about the contents of it as a certified copy of it has been produced"".
We are inclined to agree with the view taken by the Patna High Court.
In the case of Arya Printinidhi Sabha, Punjab Jullundur vs Dev Raj Vir Bhan and Anr.
it was clearly pointed out that the presump 886 tion of English law has to be applied with great caution and the Court observed as follows: ""The rule is now firmly settled that the presumption of English law that when a will is traced to the possession of the deceased and is not forthcoming at his death, is that he has destroyed it, must be applied in India with considerable caution"".
In the case of Brundaban Chandra vs Ananta Narayan Singh Deo a Division Bench of the Orissa High Court has rightly observed as follows: But there is formidable English authority for the proposition that if a testament was in the custody of the testator at the time of his death and is not forthcoming on his death it is presumed to have been destroyed by himself.
This presumption can however be rebutted; and the weight to be attached to such presumption will depend upon the character of the custody which the testator had over the will.
In England wills are usually deposited either in a Bank or with a Solicitor.
But the same presumption is hardly applicable in all circumstances in India where the habits and conditions of the people vary.
Here in India, deeds are not preserved with that amount of care as is done in England.
On the other hand, where a document is registered no care is taken at all of its custody as a certified copy is easily available, and the law allows its production in proof of the original.
Consequently, having regard to the habits and conditions of the people here, when a document like a registered will is not forthcoming after the testator 's death, presumption may well arise that it has been mislaid as seems to have happened here .
It follows that in this country a presumption of revocation of a will cannot be drawn merely from the fact of its disappearance.
. . . Where a will makes a careful and detailed disposition of the testator 's properties and nothing happens to make it probable that he wishes to revoke it, the presumption raised by the disappearance of the will may be rebutted by slight evidence, especially if it is shown that access to the box or other place of deposit where the will was kept can be obtained by persons whose interest it is to defeat the will"".
We find ourselves in agreement with the view taken by the High Court.
887 To the same effect are the decisions in Satya Charan Pal vs Ashutosh Pal & Ors., Efari Dasya vs Podei Dasya, Shib Sabitri Prasad & Ors.
vs The Collector of Meerut, Anwar Hossein vs Secretary of State for India, Chouthmal Jivarjee Poddar vs Ramachandra Jivarjee Poddar and Pt.
Devi Charan vs Durga Porshad Chhanu Lal & Ors.
The correct legal position may therefore be stated as follows: 1.
That where a will has been properly executed and registered by the testator but not found at the time of death the question whether the presumption that the testator had revoked the will can be drawn or not will depend on the facts and circumstances of each case.
Even if such a presumption is drawn it is rather a weak one in view of the habits and conditions of our people.
That the presumption is a rebuttable one and can be rebutted by the slightest possible evidence, direct or circumstantial.
For instance, where it is proved that a will was a strong and clear disposition evincing the categorical intention of the testator and there was nothing to indicate the presence of any circumstance which is likely to bring about a change in the intention of the testator so as to revoke the will suddenly, the presumption is rebutted.
That in view of the fact that in our country most of the people are not highly educated and do not in every case take the care of depositing the will in the bank or with the Solicitors or otherwise take very great care of the will as a result of which the possibility of the will being stolen, lost or surreptitiously removed by interested persons cannot be excluded, the presumption should be applied carefully.
That where the legatee is able to prove the circumstances from which it can be inferred that there could be absolutely no reason whatsoever for revoking the will or that the act of revoking the will was against the temperament and inclination of the testator, no presumption of revocation of the will can be drawn.
888 5.
That in view of the express provision of section 70 of the Act the onus lies on the objector to prove the various circumstances, viz., marriage, burning, tearing or destruction of the will.
When there is no obvious reason or clear motive for the testator to revoke the will and yet the will is not found on the death of the testator it may well be that the will was misplaced or lost or was stolen by interested persons.
We shall now apply the aforesaid principles to the facts of the present case.
It is true that the impugned will despite search was not found at the time of death of the testatrix.
At the same time it cannot be gain said that the clear finding of the courts below is that the will was definitely executed by the testatrix with a sound disposing mind and had been attested by as many as 7 witnesses and had been proved.
We have already indicated the essential features common to all the will executed by the testatrix in the past and three things appear to be very conspicuous: 1.
That relations between the testatrix and Durga Prashad were very cordial, and therefore, there could be no occasion for the testatrix to suddenly change her mind to revoke the will so as to benefit the respondent a person whom she so detested that she made a provision in the will to the effect that he should not be permitted to touch her dead body or perform her funeral rites.
The lady was of an extremely charitable and religious bent of mind and she made substantial provision for religious and charitable purposes in all the wills including the draft will exhibit C 1.
She would not without any reason revoke the will which contained clear and strong provision regarding religious and charitable purposes.
It is difficult to believe that she would shed her religious and charitable inclination by revoking the will and deleting the religious and charitable purpose contained in the will so as to benefit the respondent and make him the absolute owner of the properties without any restriction.
This seems to be wholly improbable.
That in all the dispositions Smt.
Jog Maya had seen to it that a clause was inserted in the will under which the legatee or trustee was prohibited from alienating the properties.
Indeed, if she revoked the impugned will the result will be that the property would go to the respon 889 dent without any conditions or restrictions, a conduct that would be against the temperament of the testatrix.
Apart from these features, there are other circumstances which go to show that the will was not revoked by the testatrix.
R.W. 3 admitted that Devi Charan respondent never lived in the house (house of Jog Maya) but he used to visit it once or twice a month.
Similarly, R.W. 7, another witness for the respondent, admits that Devi Charan used to visit Smt.
Jog Maya previous to her death.
Even the respondent Devi Charan admits clearly in his evidence that as he was not well, his wife had gone to see Smt.
Jog Maya on the previous evening of her illness.
In this connection, the statement of Devi Charan runs thus: ""I came to know about her illness on the previous evening.
As I was not well, my wife went to see how Smt.
Jog Maya was.
"" From the evidence adduced by the respondent himself, therefore, it appears that Devi Charan had clear access to the house of Jog Maya which he visited off and on and his wife visited the house even during the illness of Jog Maya which resulted in her death.
Devi Charan was fully aware that the will executed by Jog Maya completely deprived him of any interest in the properties.
In these circumstances, the possibility that either Devi Charan or his wife may have pilfered or stolen the will in order to deprive the appellant of its benefits cannot be excluded.
In this connection, it may be noted that the respondent has stated in his evidence that he complained to Jog Maya that he had been deprived of his right by making a trust in the name of Durga Prashad and Ram Nath and she assured him that she would destroy the trust deed and would make him the owner of the property.
This statement is undoubtedly false and would not have been made by a woman of the nature and character of Jog Maya.
Indeed, if the statement was made to him in August, 1955 as mentioned by the witness in his evidence, then there was no reason why, when the respondent filed his first objection on 27 1 1956 before the Sub Judge Delhi, he did not mention it there nor even in the second objection and the additional pleas filed by him before the District Judge, Delhi.
This shows that his statement in court is absolutely false and is made merely for the purpose of defeating the claim of respondent.
Again it appears that although the will was executed in 1947, about 8 years before her death, Smt.
Jog Maya never expressed her intention to revoke the will at any time during this period to any of the attesting witnesses of the will or to Pt.
Ram Nath who was a trustee under the draft will of her intention to revoke the will.
It is difficult to 890 believe that she would leave the entire property to the respondent whom she hated so much.
Further, there is absolutely no evidence to show that Devi Charan succeeded in gaining the favour of or winning the confidence of Smt.
Jog Maya at any time before her death so as to put her in a mood to leave the entire property absolutely to him after her death by revoking the impugned will.
Nor is there anything to show that the respondent estranged the testatrix from the appellant to such an extent that the appellant fell in her estimation.
It is also neither pleaded nor proved that since the execution of the impugned will any circumstance existed or incident happened which brought about a serious estrangement between the appellant and the testatrix so as to induce her to revoke the will.
Having regard to these circumstances mentioned above which do not appear to have been considered by the High Court at all we are clearly of the opinion that the presumption if any, that the will was revoked by Smt.
Jog Maya has been sufficiently rebutted and the objector has miserably failed to discharge the onus which lay on him to prove that the will was revoked.
Moreover, the will being a registered one and being the product of the free will of the testatrix there must be strong and cogent reasons for holding that it was revoked.
The fact that the will was not found despite search at the time of death of Smt.
Jog Maya in the circumstances is not sufficient to justify a presumption that the will was revoked.
In the circumstances of this case particularly having regard to the fact that the respondent who would be interested in destroying the will had an access to the house of the testatrix, the presumption would be that the will was either stolen or misplaced by him or at his instance.
For these reasons, we allow this appeal with costs, set aside the judgment of the Division Bench of the High Court and restore the judgment of the Single Judge of the High Court and allow the application of the appellant for probate.
N.V.K. Appeal allowed.
","The respondent was the adopted son of the testatrix who made a will in 1935 declaring that her properties were dedicated to a private temple of hers in her house and would remain so for all times to come.
In 1938, however, she revoked the earlier will and dedicated a part of the house and certain other items for the benefit of the temple.
But she expressly prohibited the respondent from performing her funeral rites and gave certain rights over the property to the appellant and his wife.
In 1947 she again revoked the will made in 1938 and bequeathed her properties to the appellant without right of alienation and had also clearly stated that the respondent should have no concern with her estate and should not be allowed to touch her dead body.
On her death, though the original will was not found, a draft will which was almost of the same time was discovered.
The recitals in the draft were almost the same as in the will of 1947.
In the appellant 's petition before the District Judge for grant of letters of administration or probate the respondent contended that the testatrix was not of sound disposing mind at the time of the alleged execution of the will and that the appellant had exercised undue influence over her in the execution of the will.
It was further alleged that the will was subsequently revoked and that was the reason why it was not found in the house despite search.
The District Judge accepted the respondent 's version and rejected the petition for probate.
On appeal a single Judge of the High Court found that the will was genuine and had not been revoked.
On further appeal the Division Bench restored the order of the District Judge dismissing the appellant 's application for probate by drawing a presumption that the testatrix had revoked the will by destroying it before her death.
In appeal to this Court it was contended on behalf of the appellant that the High Court was in error in drawing a presumption of revocation of the will in view of the express provisions of section 70 of the and in the alternative even if the presumption was available to the respondent the same being a rebuttable one.
was sufficiently rebutted by facts and circumstances proved in the case.
Allowing the appeal, ^ HELD: The presumption that the will was revoked by the testatrix had been sufficiently rebutted and the respondent had failed to discharge the onus which lay on him to prove that the will was revoked.
The will being a product of free will of the testatrix there must be strong and cogent reasons for holding that it was revoked.
The fact that the will was not found, despite search, was not 874 sufficient to justify a presumption that the will was revoked.
Having regard to the fact that the respondent was interested in destroying the will and had access to the house, the presumption would be that the will was either stolen or misplaced by him or at his instance.
[890C E] The correct legal position may be stated thus: (i) Where a will has been properly executed and registered by the testator but not found at the time of death the question whether the presumption that the testator had revoked the will can be drawn or not will depend on the facts and circumstances of each case.

</s>","  The appellant, Durga Prasad, was the sole legatee and executor under the will of Smt.
Jog Maya who died on 22 10 1955.
The appellant filed a petition before the District Judge, Delhi for grant of letters of administration or probate.
The respondent, Devi Charan, however, opposed the application on the ground that the will was not genuine and had been executed by undue influence exercised by the appellant over the testatrix.
The District Judge accepted the plea of the respondent and dismissed the application.
The appellant then went up in appeal to the High Court which was heard by Mr. Justice P. D. Sharma.
The learned Judge held that the will was a genuine document and had not been revoked.
Accordingly, he allowed the petition of the appellant and issued letters of probate or administration.
The respondent went up in appeal to the Division Bench which reversed the finding of the Single Judge and restored the order of the District Judge dismissing the application for probate.
It appears from a perusal of the judgment of the Division Bench that the learned Judges did not accept the plea of the appellant that the testatrix was of sound disposing mind when she executed the will and that the will was not revoked.
They further held that the appellant had acted with undue influence in inducing the testatrix to execute the will in his favour.
In view of this finding, they held that the will was not a valid document and the appellant was not entitled to the grant of probate or administration.
The appellant has now come up in appeal to this Court.
The main question for consideration in this appeal is whether the findings of the two courts below are correct.
The appellant's case is that Smt.
Jog Maya was a resident of Mohalla Rang Mahal, Nahar Sadat Khan, Delhi and although she had an adopted son, namely, the respondent Pt.
Devi Charan there was no love lost between Smt.
Jog Maya and Devi Charan so much so that in her will the testatrix expressly mentioned that the adopted son should not be permitted to perform her funeral rites on her death nor should he be allowed to touch her body.
The appellant Durga Prasad on the other hand was looking after the affairs of the lady and doing her work from time to time.
It was perhaps in lieu of the services rendered by the appellant that Smt.
Jog Maya executed a will in his favour on 1st July, 1947.
The proceedings for probate were contested by Devi Charan who denied the execution of the will on the ground that Smt.
Jogmaya was not of sound disposing mind when she is said to have executed the will but had been persuaded to do so by undue influence exercised by the appellant in executing the will.
It was also alleged by the respondent Devi Charan that the will was subsequently revoked and that is why it was not found in the house despite every possible search.
The District Judge accepted the plea of the respondent and dismissed the application for probate by his order dated 3 5 1957.
The appellant, therefore, filed an appeal to the High Court which was heard by Mr. Justice P. D. Sharma who reversed the decision of the District Judge and found that the will was a genuine document and had not been revoked.

They further held that the appellant had acted with undue influence in inducing the testatrix to execute the will in his favour.
In view of this finding, they held that the will was not a valid document and the appellant was not entitled to the grant of probate or administration.
The appellant has now come up in appeal to this Court.
The main question for consideration in this appeal is whether the findings of the two courts below are correct.
The appellant's case is that Smt.
Jog Maya was a resident of Mohalla Rang Mahal, Nahar Sadat Khan, Delhi and although she had an adopted son, namely, the respondent Pt.
Devi Charan there was no love lost between Smt.
Jog Maya and Devi Charan so much so that in her will the testatrix expressly mentioned that the adopted son should not be permitted to perform her funeral rites on her death nor should he be allowed to touch her body.
The appellant Durga Prasad on the other hand was looking after the affairs of the lady and doing her work from time to time.
It was perhaps in lieu of the services rendered by the appellant that Smt.
Jog Maya executed a will in his favour on 1st July, 1947.
The proceedings for probate were contested by Devi Charan who denied the execution of the will on the ground that Smt.
Jogmaya was not of sound disposing mind when she is said to have executed the will but had been persuaded to do so by undue influence exercised by the appellant in executing the will.
It was also alleged by the respondent Devi Charan that the will was subsequently revoked and that is why it was not found in the house despite every possible search.
The District Judge accepted the plea of the respondent and dismissed the application for probate by his order dated 3 5 5 1957.
The appellant, therefore, filed an appeal to this Court.
which was not a valid document and the appellant was not entitled to the grant of probate or administration.
The appellant's case is that Smt.

### Instruction:
Formulate a potential public interest litigation based on the given case.

### Input:
The case M. R. Balaji And Others vs State Of Mysore, 1963 AIR 649, 1962 SCR Supl. (1) 439

","A potential public interest litigation (PIL) that can be formulated based on the case of M. R. Balaji And Others vs State Of Mysore is to challenge the constitutionality of reservation orders that exceed the reasonable limits set by Article 15(4) of the Constitution of India. The PIL can argue that such excessive reservations, like the 68% reservation order in this case, violate the principles of equality, efficiency, and national interest. It can seek a declaration from the court that reservation orders exceeding a certain percentage, such as 50%, are prima facie unreasonable and unconstitutional. The PIL can also request the court to direct the government to review and revise reservation policies to ensure they are within reasonable limits and do not disproportionately affect the interests of society as a whole. Additionally, the PIL can advocate for the consideration of factors beyond caste, such as educational and social backwardness, in determining the beneficiaries of reservations. This PIL would aim to strike a balance between the rights of backward classes and the overall welfare of the nation.</s>","A potential public interest litigation could be filed to challenge the reservation policy for admission to professional colleges in the state of Mysore. The petitioners could argue that the reservation policy violates their right to equality under Articles 14 and 15 of the Constitution. They could contend that the reservation for backward classes and districts should not exceed the 50% limit set by the Supreme Court in the Balaji case. Additionally, they could argue that the selection process should be based solely on merit rather than caste or district. The litigation could aim to strike down the reservation policy as unconstitutional and seek a court order directing the state government to implement a fair and merit-based admissions process. This would ensure equal opportunities for all students regardless of their background and promote a more inclusive education system.   It's important to note that this is just one possible formulation of a public interest litigation, and the specific arguments and legal grounds used may vary depending on the specific circumstances and facts of the case. It's always recommended to consult with legal experts before filing any litigation."

### Instruction:
Explain the application of the principles of natural justice in the provided case.

### Input:
Miss Mohini Jain vs State Of Karnataka And Ors on 30 July, 1992

","The principles of natural justice were applied in the case of Miss Mohini Jain vs State Of Karnataka And Ors on 30 July, 1992. Natural justice is a fundamental principle of law that ensures fairness and procedural fairness in legal proceedings. In this case, the principles of natural justice were invoked to protect the rights of the petitioner and ensure a fair hearing.

The first principle of natural justice is the principle of audi alteram partem, which means 'hear the other side.' It requires that both parties to a dispute be given an opportunity to present their case and be heard. In this case, Miss Mohini Jain, the petitioner, filed a writ petition challenging the State notification allowing capitation fees. This petition provided her with an opportunity to present her arguments and be heard by the court.

The second principle of natural justice is the principle of nemo judex in causa sua, which means 'no one should be a judge in their own cause.' It requires that the decision-maker be impartial and unbiased. In this case, the Supreme Court, as the highest court of the land, acted as the decision-maker. The court ensured that it was impartial and unbiased in its decision-making process.

The application of these principles of natural justice ensured that the petitioner's rights were protected and that the decision-making process was fair and just. It upheld the principles of fairness, equality, and due process, which are essential for a just legal system.</s>","In the case of Miss Mohini Jain vs State Of Karnataka And Ors on 30 July, 1992, the principles of natural justice were applied to ensure fairness and procedural safeguards for the parties involved. The court recognized the importance of these principles in upholding the rule of law and protecting individual rights.

The first principle of natural justice, known as 'audi alteram partem,' or 'hear the other side,' was applied by the court. This means that both parties should have an opportunity to present their arguments and evidence before a decision is made. In this case, the petitioners (Miss Mohini Jain) were given the opportunity to present their case against the reservation policy for admission to medical colleges in Karnataka state. They argued that the reservation policy violated their right to equality under Articles 14 and 15 of the Constitution.

The second principle of natural justice, known as 'procedural fairness,' was also applied by the court. This principle ensures that the procedures followed during legal proceedings are fair and just. In this case, the court examined whether the reservation policy was based on valid grounds and if it was implemented in a fair manner. It considered the evidence presented by both sides and evaluated the reasoning behind the reservation policy.

By applying the principles of natural justice, the court ensured that the parties had a fair hearing and that the decision was based on a thorough evaluation of the facts and legal arguments. This helped maintain public confidence in the judicial system and upheld the principles of justice and fairness.

Overall, the application of the principles of natural justice in this case reinforced the importance of fairness, transparency, and due process in the administration of justice. It demonstrated the commitment of the court to protecting individual rights and promoting a fair and impartial legal system."
